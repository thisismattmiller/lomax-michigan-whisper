<li>The World's Most Beautiful World.</li>
<li>Well, there have yet been people that cannot help themselves.</li>
<li>I said, Boy, they ain't gonna help you, unless you leave me a charge one year.</li>
<li>After your case is open, they'll give you plenty of fuel and clothes.</li>
<li>I said, Boy, they won't help you, until you have told everything you know.</li>
<li>You go down to the welfare, they'll make you sit there all day.</li>
<li>They'll make you sit there all day.</li>
<li>I said, They know they ain't gonna help you, they'll make you sit there and wait.</li>
<li>Oh, boy, I believe I'll go there myself.</li>
<li>Yes, boy, I believe I'll go there myself.</li>
<li>I say, I'll tell 'em I ain't got nothing that I declare I need to you.</li>
<li>I declare I need to you.</li>
<li>â™ª</li>
<li>This song was composed</li>
<li>1936, on the 22nd of December,</li>
<li>by Samson Pitman in Detroit, Michigan.</li>
<li>It's the true fact in Detroit about the wealth and the condition of the people.</li>
