<li>2285A.</li>
<li>That was Eric Merchant's daughter in a hill, and Rick counted well.</li>
<li>She was proper tall and handsome, and her parents loved her well.</li>
<li>She was admired by lords and squires, but it was all in vain.</li>
<li>There was but one young farmer's son that Mary's heart could gain.</li>
<li>A long time they had corded, and they named their wedding day.</li>
<li>Her parents, they consented, but her brothers, they did say,</li>
<li>To one Rick, Lord, we have pledged our word, and him you cannot shun,</li>
<li>or we'll betray, and we will slay your countenance, farmer's son.</li>
<li>There was a fair in their next town, her brothers went straight away,</li>
<li>and requested of Willie's company with them to pass the day.</li>
<li>As the night came on returning home, they said, Your race is run,</li>
<li>and with a mistake the life did take off our countenance, farmer's son.</li>
<li>That night on Mary's pillow she had a dreadful dream.</li>
<li>She beheld her own true love down in a pearly stream.</li>
<li>The young Mary arose, put on her clothes, and to the spot it ran,</li>
<li>and dead and cold she did be, oh, her countenance, farmer's son.</li>
<li>The tears rolled down her rosy cheeks and mingled with the gore,</li>
<li>and in her wild incestant grief she kissed him o'er and o'er.</li>
<li>She gathered green leaves from all the trees to shade him from the sun,</li>
<li>and all night and day she passed that way with her countenance, farmer's son.</li>
<li>Hunger it came creeping on poor Mary wept with woe,</li>
<li>and to renounce those murderers she straightway homed it ago,</li>
<li>Oh, parents dear, you soon will hear the dreadful deed that's done.</li>
<li>In yonder vale lies cold and pale my countenance, the farmer's son.</li>
<li>Up step they held his brother, and he said it was not he.</li>
<li>The same replied the younger, and he swore most bitterly,</li>
<li>Mary, don't you be dismayed, I'll try the law to shun you, don't they?</li>
<li>Indeed, and your hearts will bleed for my countenance, farmer's son.</li>
<li>Those villains were found guilty, and they were sentenced for to die,</li>
<li>and for the crime of murder in an early grave of lies.</li>
<li>Young Mary sought both night and day to her own true love did run,</li>
<li>and in that house now this maid now dwells for her countenance, farmer's son.</li>
