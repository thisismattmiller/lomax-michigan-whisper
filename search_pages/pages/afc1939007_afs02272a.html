<li>I guess the word is kind of weird, I can't sing.</li>
<li>My boy, if you will listen, I will sing to you a song.</li>
<li>It's all about a fisherman that lives in this little town.</li>
<li>He is a well-known fisherman and lives here in our town.</li>
<li>He is a noted liar and his name is Yankee Brown.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>This man was born in York State and he told to me one time</li>
<li>that he came to Beaver Island in 1479.</li>
<li>So then he went to fishing and followed up his trade</li>
<li>and several times he told me that his fortune he had made.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>He said when he was fishing down on Hog Island ground,</li>
<li>he swore he caught a whitefish that weighed 150 pounds.</li>
<li>At first they didn't believe him until he began to swear.</li>
<li>He said he'd fetch his young son West to prove the story there.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>He has a boat he calls the Matty and the truth to you all to tell.</li>
<li>For several times he has rebuilt her and indeed he done it well.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>He said when he was beating once down to Hog Island ground</li>
<li>and when he put about that the Matty she lay over so far</li>
<li>that she scooped in tree trough.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>At first they didn't believe him until he began to swear.</li>
<li>He said he'd bring his young son West to prove the story there.</li>
<li>At first they didn't believe him until he began to swear.</li>
<li>He said he'd bring his young son West to prove the story there.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>He is living on the beavers and he is keeping still.</li>
<li>For the old dick will never be at rest.</li>
<li>He has old Yankee in hell.</li>
<li>And sing to the eye, right to the arm, with a wackle or a lie.</li>
<li>That's all about ya.</li>
<li>Where did you learn this song?</li>
<li>I learned it from many years ago from a member of the name Frank McCauley.</li>
<li>Do you know who made it up?</li>
<li>Yes, Frank McCauley.</li>
<li>Oh, and did he make it up about himself or about somebody else?</li>
<li>He knew nothing about Yankee Bells.</li>
<li>Oh, was that a real character?</li>
<li>Yeah, that's a real character, yes.</li>
<li>Was he an awful liar, just like the song said?</li>
<li>Yeah, an awful liar.</li>
<li>An Irish liar, huh?</li>
<li>No, I don't think he's Irish.</li>
<li>What big buddy, Andy?</li>
<li>I don't think he's Irish.</li>
<li>What nationality was Yankee Brown?</li>
<li>Andy?</li>
<li>French.</li>
<li>French?</li>
<li>French, he was French.</li>
<li>Oh.</li>
<li>Yankee Brown?</li>
<li>How long ago was this song made up?</li>
<li>Oh, about 45 years ago.</li>
<li>Oh, did a lot of people used to sing it when you were a young guy?</li>
<li>Yeah, when I was a little fella, a grown-up young man.</li>
<li>Yeah, I used to hear that song, yeah.</li>
<li>The fishermen used to sing it out on their boats or when?</li>
<li>Well, they sang it in country places, different places.</li>
