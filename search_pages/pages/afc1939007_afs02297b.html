<li>2297, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>My boy, the son, Roddy, was a great friend.</li>
<li>He had a mower and all, then the door from the old days.</li>
<li>I'm like, Geez, Roddy said he sent me to left out a fine man for you.</li>
<li>And he was joshin' in back and forth.</li>
<li>I'm one thing and down.</li>
<li>Him and Roddy was pretty good friends and by jeez, he kept talking to the left about...</li>
<li>Her name was Maloy.</li>
<li>Her first name combined with Maloy.</li>
<li>He said, I've got a fine man for you and I'm going to take him down and introduce him.</li>
<li>By jeez, he introduced him to come together like that.</li>
<li>That's the kind of guy I am.</li>
<li>The order has come by then, I'm bound for Queenston.</li>
<li>They order that I dare not fail to obey.</li>
<li>For when that I'm pleading, they jail in the morning.</li>
<li>I know she'll be there for to see me away.</li>
<li>Haste and ado, there's no time for eloping. By my own cruel fate, I must only abide.</li>
<li>Big goodbye to old Ireland and kind friends and parents.</li>
<li>And cross o'er the ocean, both stormy and wide.</li>
<li>Oh, what was to me the crime they imputed?</li>
<li>Oh, was it for false perjury at the bar?</li>
<li>Or for taking the life of my own fellow creature?</li>
<li>This tart-hearted judge gave me the sentence bar.</li>
<li>Oh, no, it was the father of the girl I loved dearly.</li>
<li>That robber, he swore vengeance on his daughter and me.</li>
<li>And I, but a servant, could gain such a treasure.</li>
<li>Although she was very far above my degree.</li>
<li>He hired a spy for to watch our correspondence.</li>
<li>And tried many plans on me, vengeance to take the keys off his drawer.</li>
<li>He placed under my pillow and banknotes well marked, he placed into my purse.</li>
<li>And now I, I knew I couldn't do it.</li>
<li>As I went a-walking along evening of late.</li>
<li>Where flora's gay mantel, they field deck array.</li>
<li>And I carelessly wandered where I did not know.</li>
<li>By the banks of a river that runs near Glencoe.</li>
<li>That runs near Glencoe.</li>
<li>By the banks of a river that runs near Glencoe.</li>
<li>Like flora that laughs that Mount Ida had won.</li>
<li>There approached me a lassie as bright as the sun.</li>
<li>And the ribbons and cartons all around heard it flow.</li>
<li>Oh which once reared Macadondo, they prided of Glencoe.</li>
<li>Said my fair damsel, your enchanting smile.</li>
<li>And your comely fine features does my heart beguile.</li>
<li>And if your kind affection on any would you bestow.</li>
<li>We would bless the happy hour we met in Glencoe.</li>
<li>She said my dear young man, your suit I disdain.</li>
<li>For I once had a sweetheart, Macadondo by name.</li>
<li>But he went to the war about twelve years ago.</li>
<li>And a maid I will remain till he returns to Glencoe.</li>
<li>Till he returns to Glencoe.</li>
<li>And returns to Glencoe.</li>
<li>And a maid I will remain till he returns to Glencoe.</li>
<li>Perhaps young Macadondo regards not your name.</li>
<li>He may have placed his affection on some foreign name.</li>
<li>And he may have forgotten for all that you know.</li>
<li>Oh that charming young lassie he left in Glencoe.</li>
<li>That he left in Glencoe.</li>
<li>Oh that charming fair lassie he left in Glencoe.</li>
<li>Macadondo from his promise would never depart.</li>
<li>For true love and honor is found in his heart.</li>
<li>They Frenchman they standard he will soon overthrow.</li>
<li>And with flanger he returns to my arms in Glencoe.</li>
<li>When he saw her so faithful he pulled out a glove.</li>
<li>That she gave him when farting as a token of love.</li>
<li>And she hung on to him. She hung on.</li>
