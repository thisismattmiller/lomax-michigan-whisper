<li>I don't like it, so I don't know if you would, but I didn't know what else to put to it.</li>
<li>I never heard anybody else start to sing it that way.</li>
<li>I was the first one to ever sing the song, as I know it now.</li>
<li>I never heard anybody ever sing the song.</li>
<li>To start, this fellow helped make up, and he sung it afterwards with me.</li>
<li>He said that was all right. We put the two together and sung it together.</li>
<li>It's all right now.</li>
<li>One evening in November, I happened for to stray to Johnny Carter's lumbering camp on the banks of the Chippewa. With him to try to grub and chop and level down the roads to make ready for our wintry snow to what their logs are told.</li>
<li>With grub hose prising axes, we loosened the rods and stumps, and we filled up our hollows as we leveled down the lumps.</li>
<li>Now to be a perfect woodsman and to learn the lumbering trade, you must spend a certain length of time a toiling on the grade.</li>
<li>Now choppers grind your axes and sawyers file your saws, and fincters mend your harnesses, for these are lumbering logs.</li>
<li>The blacksmiths and the thinkers, they mend our tools so neat, we ne'er not fear the work, they boys our tools, they're all complete.</li>
<li>Our cooks, they are good natured, we get the best of pours, we get the best variety our country can afford.</li>
<li>Potatoes, apples, turnips, beans, and syrups are pure and sweet, although we have no appetite, we cannot help but eat.</li>
<li>There's bread and biscuits, pie and cookies all seasoned to our taste, and our cooks be very careful, there is nothing goes to waste.</li>
<li>Our sleeping camp is well arranged with bunks long, wide, and deep, and as night upon us reaches, boys, we quickly go to sleep.</li>
<li>The chore boy in the morning gets up and starts the fire, that keeps our camp so neat and clean, we cannot but admire.</li>
<li>Your daughter see us working as the weather is mild and fair, with chains, canes, hooks, beavers, how we work the stately pine.</li>
<li>From daylight on till dark, my boys, we tile day after day, working in the pine, which on the banks a chip away.</li>
<li>As winter is all over and our lumber is all done, we'll go out on the river, boys, and there we'll have some fun.</li>
<li>We'll start our logs off floating, and we'll drive them down the stream, and before we face for homebred boys, we'll sing the Lumbering theme.</li>
<li>That's what we're going to sing.</li>
<li>That's fine. Did you make this up?</li>
<li>Yeah, I did another part of it.</li>
<li>What was his name?</li>
<li>Well, I forget his name. Now, he slipped my mind, and he's dead. I forget his name. I can't think of it. I was trying to think of his name twenty times.</li>
<li>I just know we met winter, and we kind of got together and made up this year's song, and he's dead now.</li>
<li>How did you happen to decide to make this one up?</li>
<li>Well, we was working there, and there were some fellows that made up some songs, and we got to thinking about it.</li>
<li>We just started up, and one said one thing, another another, and we kept on making the song. That's the way you kind of get to a song up.</li>
<li>Did anybody else sing this song after you made it?</li>
<li>Yes, lots of fellows made it or sung it after they learned it.</li>
<li>And then it just went from place to place and sing it a little bit different. Add a little bit more to it. I've heard something more to it than I could get from a kid, but a little bit.</li>
<li>What year was this?</li>
<li>I don't know if you can see that there. It was about '55, '60 years ago, '58 years ago. About '55. No, I guess not quite long.</li>
<li>And exactly what I lost there?</li>
<li>A chip away, a river here.</li>
<li>Oh, a male lucky one.</li>
<li>Johnny Carl's lumber camp on the banks of Chipaway.</li>
<li>Down here, this side of Sonny Brook. Not Sonny Brook, but by this year, what the hell they call it, this side of the dam, you know, down here.</li>
<li>That's the old dam used to be. They call it over in that way now. They got it. The old make it out on M27. These are the Chipaway River.</li>
<li>That, this side was down in there, but the old camels used to be in there.</li>
