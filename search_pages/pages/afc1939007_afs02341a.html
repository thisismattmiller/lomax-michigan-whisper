<li>AFS recording number two three four one side a strips one and two</li>
<li>I've been a thief from North Dakota, worked on a home set 'bout one year, then I better go to Minnesota</li>
<li>Used to look on a big state fair, get me a ticket, got me a bottle, dress up, all looks on a side</li>
<li>Yum-yum, yum-yum, have a gun, feels so good, I like to fight</li>
<li>Next morning I've been waked up, fella, fella, him say Ben, there's St. Paul</li>
<li>I tell you, I got a headache, been a-drinking alcohol</li>
<li>Walk around streets in St. Paul, I sense Svenska anywhere</li>
<li>You'll find a car, go to Minneapolis, shop and plan, see Svensmann there</li>
<li>Walking 'round in Sunset, Minneapolis, got these to come, look for fun</li>
<li>Here I found a nice big sweet girl, she sleep me on the back, say good news, fun</li>
<li>I turn 'round and feel so funny, never see this girl again</li>
<li>I've been foxy, say hello, Tilly, won't you have a little drink</li>
<li>The tank drink can feel so yally, and a-dance and a-sing</li>
<li>I still say hello, I'll treat, fellas, I'll still pay for a hell of a thing</li>
<li>Tilly say I've been good, fellas, looking mighty good to her</li>
<li>She says, Sven, come on and show you, best time did it ever hurt</li>
<li>Ready, riding on in, I slew the gun to the city you to see</li>
<li>He says, Sven, ten downtown dollars, 'cause I've been on an awful spree</li>
<li>Looked, gimme pocket, got no money, you'd him say, cannot, no damn</li>
<li>I've been left for this for ten months, ten dollars or ten million yales</li>
<li>I'm going back to North Dakota, got a job on a farm somewhere</li>
<li>I've killed two dolls, the sweet fellers, go to hell with the big steak pair</li>
<li>A Persian kitty, perfumed and fair, straight out to the kitchen, door for air</li>
<li>When a tomcat, lean and lithe and strong and yellow and dirty, came along</li>
<li>She sniffed at the perfume, Persian cat, and he stuttered about with much a clap</li>
<li>And fitting in time to pass, he whispered, kiddo, you sure have class</li>
<li>Fitting and proper was her reply as she arched her whiskers over her eyes</li>
<li>I'm ribboned, I sleep in a pillow of silk, and daily I'm bathed in certified milk</li>
<li>Yet you're never contented to the things you've got, and I try to be happy, and happy I'm not</li>
<li>Why would be joyful, I should indeed, for I am highly pedigree</li>
<li>Cheer up, says the tomcat with a smile, and trust your new found friend for a while</li>
<li>For you need to escape from your backyard fence, dearie, all you need is experience</li>
<li>And the morning after the night before, the cat came back at the hour of four</li>
<li>The innocent look in her eyes had went in a smile on her face</li>
<li>With a smile of content, and after days when children came to the Persian kitty of pedigreed fame</li>
<li>They weren't Persian, they were black and tan, and she told them their pa was a traveling man</li>
<li>And this is the answer, the returns from it</li>
<li>A Persian kitty, perfumed and fair, did not go out on the kitchen porch for air</li>
<li>But she saw a tomcat taking a stroll, and she laid a plan to get his role</li>
<li>For she knew that he was a country swell, and would fall for any tales she'd tell</li>
<li>For he, thinking she'd be sweet and innocent, she'd be full of guile and devilishment</li>
<li>She led him along to a quiet spot where they bring his along at the dollar he bought</li>
<li>And as he spent his hard-earned tin, she stole his watch and his diamond pin</li>
<li>And when she had him as clean as a bone, she ran off with another and left him alone</li>
<li>Hungered and footsore, to trod the way back to the farm in the new Mount Hay</li>
