<li>Two-three, two-five, side-B.</li>
<li>Milwaukee was excited as it never was before.</li>
<li>Oh, in learning of the fire bells all around,</li>
<li>they were ringing to eternity for a thousand souls or more.</li>
<li>Oh, the new whole house was burning to the ground.</li>
<li>Oh, the firemen worked like demons and did all within their power.</li>
<li>Oh, trying to save and trying to soothe the pain,</li>
<li>it made the strongest heart feel sick within less than a half hour.</li>
<li>Oh, the new whole house was burning to the ground.</li>
<li>We'll never forget those two orphans.</li>
<li>Bad luck seemed to come in their way.</li>
<li>It seemed so, they came to our city.</li>
<li>Oh, the lives of our dear ones today.</li>
<li>A boy stood in the window and his mother stood below.</li>
<li>And the flames were gathering around him everywhere.</li>
<li>Oh, she upraised hands to pray for him and she knelt down in the snow.</li>
<li>Oh, he jumped, perhaps, to meet a harder death.</li>
<li>We'll never forget those two orphans.</li>
<li>Bad luck seemed to come in their way.</li>
<li>It seemed so, they came to our city.</li>
<li>Oh, the lives of our dear ones today.</li>
<li>A man stood in the window and his wife stood by his side.</li>
<li>Oh, they say that man, he was a millionaire.</li>
<li>He prayed for God to save them, but his prayers, they proved in vain.</li>
<li>Oh, the new whole house was stumbling to the ground.</li>
<li>We'll never forget those two orphans.</li>
<li>Bad luck seemed to come in their way.</li>
<li>Oh, it seemed so, they came to our city.</li>
<li>The lives of our dear ones today.</li>
<li>What is that song about?</li>
<li>I don't know the name of the song, but I was there and witnessed that song.</li>
<li>I've seen that fire, absolutely seen it.</li>
<li>The whole town burned down?</li>
<li>Oh, no.</li>
<li>The theater.</li>
<li>The orphans were playing.</li>
<li>The play was The Orphans.</li>
<li>The two orphans.</li>
<li>Did you see the play?</li>
<li>Were you in the theater?</li>
<li>I was in a vessel.</li>
<li>My own schooner, laying there.</li>
<li>It was in the winter, in February, and another man was taking care of another vessel, laying</li>
<li>alongside of mine.</li>
<li>And he was over with me.</li>
<li>It was 10 in the evening together.</li>
<li>And we were figuring on going to that theater.</li>
<li>It was a damned theater, you know, we thought, because it had never been showed in Milwaukee</li>
<li>before, and it was a new one.</li>
<li>It was a new one.</li>
<li>And so we had a storm so hard that night, and the wind was blowing so awful hard, and</li>
<li>storms, no snow, and we wouldn't go.</li>
<li>So, around about 10 o'clock, we heard the beat, we heard the beat, we heard the beat,</li>
<li>we heard the beat.</li>
