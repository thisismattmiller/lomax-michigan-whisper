<li>2290B</li>
<li>The Wedding Bells Were Ringing On A Moonlight Winter Night</li>
<li>The Church Was Deprived All Within Was Gay And Bright</li>
<li>A Mother With Her B.B. Came And Stood Out By The Door</li>
<li>She Thought About Those Same Bells Ringing For Her Three Years Before</li>
<li>I'd Like To Be Administered She Told The Sixth And Old</li>
<li>Just For The Sake Of Baby To Protect Him From The Cold</li>
<li>But She Told Her That The Wedding There Was For The Rich And Grand</li>
<li>And With An Eager Watching Crow Outside She'd Have To Stand</li>
<li>While The Wedding Bells Were Ringing While The Bride And Groom Were There</li>
<li>Marching Up The Isle Together While The Organ Feel In There Telling Tales Of Fond Desection</li>
<li>Lying Never More Too Far Was Just Another Fatal Wedding</li>
<li>Just Another Broken Heart</li>
<li>She Asked The Sixth And Once Again To Let Her Pass Inside</li>
<li>For Baby's Sake You May Step In, The Grey-haired Man Replied</li>
<li>Does Anyone Know A Reason Why This Couple Should Not Wed?</li>
<li>Speak Now Or Hold Your Feast Forever, Twice Last The Preacher Said</li>
<li>I Must Object The Woman Cried With Voice Both Neat And Mild</li>
<li>The Bride's Groom Is My Husband Sir And Is Our Little Child</li>
<li>What Truth Have You The Preacher Asked? My Aunt And She Replied</li>
<li>She Raised The Baby Now To Say The Little One Had Died</li>
<li>While The Wedding Bells Were Ringing While The Bride And Groom Were There</li>
<li>Marching Up The Isle Together While The Organ Feel In There Telling Tales Of Fond Desection</li>
<li>Lying Never More Too Far Was Just Another Fatal Wedding</li>
<li>Just Another Broken Heart</li>
<li>The Fair Inside The Bride Then Took The Outcast By The Arms</li>
<li>We Will Care For You Too Like They Said You Have Saved Our Child From Harm</li>
<li>The Father, Mother, Bride And Outcast Quickly Drove Away</li>
<li>Father Died By His Own Hand Before The Break Of Day</li>
<li>No Wedding Feast Was Set At Night Two Graves Were Made Next Day</li>
<li>One For The Little Grave, Babe That Died And One For The Lady</li>
<li>This Story Has Been Often Showed By The Fireside Warm And Bright</li>
<li>While The Bride And Groom Were Not Catching Just A Little Wedding Night</li>
<li>Why Did You Learn It?</li>
<li>Oh, we played that in South Haven.</li>
<li>In South Haven?</li>
<li>Years ago.</li>
<li>From whom did you learn it?</li>
<li>I don't know.</li>
<li>You can't remember?</li>
<li>Oh, no. It's a long ago.</li>
<li>Do you know any others like it?</li>
<li>Oh, the Scotch Brigade is pretty good. You know, I worked hard today, I guess.</li>
<li>Maybe I'm kind of out of commission tonight.</li>
<li>And you don't remember just where in South Haven you learned it?</li>
<li>My home.</li>
<li>At your home. They sang it in your home. What a good song.</li>
<li>It was a good song. And I could use to sing it. I could sing it, but it was kind of on the edge.</li>
<li>The End.</li>
