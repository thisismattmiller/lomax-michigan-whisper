<li>AFS recording number 2327, side B, strips 1 and 2.</li>
<li>The only had a son, he was brave and was manly, before he'd bring his father home from the Isle of St. Helene.</li>
<li>Oh, he swore by his sword, he'd defy all nations, yet he'd bring his father home from the Isle of St. Helene.</li>
<li>Oh, my name is Edward Cullen's worth, as you may understand, my name is Edward Cullen's worth, as you may understand.</li>
<li>I was borned in the town of Waterford, in Huron's happy land, when I was young and innocent, and beauty on me smiles.</li>
<li>Oh, my parents doubted on their son, for I was their only child.</li>
<li>My father bound me to a trade in Waterford fair town, oh, he bound me to a cooper by the name of William Brown.</li>
<li>I served my master manfully until eighteen months or more, then I shipped on board of the ocean queen's bound for Bell Phrases shore.</li>
<li>And when we struck Bell Phrases shore, we met with Captain Moore, oh, the commander of the flying clod, belonging to Trimor.</li>
<li>Oh, to the young man would you like with me, on a slaving wide to go, to the burning shores of Africa, where the sugar came to grow.</li>
<li>Oh, the flying clod was a clipper ship, two thousand tons or more, oh, she'd sail round in a ship that sailed from Baltimore.</li>
<li>And her sails was white as the driven snow, on them they wore no specks, and eighty-nine brass mounted guns she carried on her deck.</li>
<li>We all consented, but thy brave lad, we rode them straight to land. Oh, two of them was Boston boys, and two from Newfoundland.</li>
<li>And one of them was a Irish lad, belonging to Trimor. I wished a god I had joined those youths and went with them on shore.</li>
