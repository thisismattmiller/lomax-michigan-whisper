<li>2353A.</li>
<li>Nine years ago, I was thinking of my land, two brogues on the feet and the shovel in me hand,</li>
<li>But I started to think...</li>
<li>Nine years ago, I was thinking of my land, two brogues on the feet and the shovel in me hand,</li>
<li>But I started to think...</li>
<li>Pity for to see such a tall husband like a diggin' turf on the day.</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>So I lay down me shovels to Kansas Bay,</li>
<li>Movin' off to the war like a jolly young glazed,</li>
<li>Met the sergeant of the army shore, he asked me to enlist,</li>
<li>Beat a long whisk of japers, put the money in my fist,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now here's a half a crown and a half a penny more,</li>
<li>You go to headquarters, you get a half a score,</li>
<li>Headquarters says, aye, Mr. Sergeant, good-bye, sweet, not like the green quarters,</li>
<li>And neither would I, musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now headquarters is that, this isn't what I mean,</li>
<li>You go to headquarters, they fit you out in green,</li>
<li>You go to headquarters, they fit you out so rare,</li>
<li>That the ladies will laugh that you're coming to the fair,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now the first thing they gave me was a sloth to call,</li>
<li>With two strips of leather to buckle at the throw,</li>
<li>A sword at the side and a pistol in the hand,</li>
<li>Sure to give everything before me at the word of command,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now the next thing they gave me, it wasn't over far,</li>
<li>With that old, all-bright, old outfit for the car,</li>
<li>I threw my leg over and gave her the seal,</li>
<li>And a sniff like a devil began to kick up her heels,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now the next thing they gave me, it was a long gun,</li>
<li>And under the trigger they planted me some,</li>
<li>Placed me finger on the trigger and the thing began to smoke,</li>
<li>And it gave me more a shoulder, a devil of a poke,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now, Mr. McGuire, you may think it's my friend,</li>
<li>The place that you tool in any man's hand,</li>
<li>Now, Mr. McGuire, I think I shall retire,</li>
<li>For the thing is running mad, can't you see it's set to fire,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now nine years have over, if the gun hadn't stuck,</li>
<li>At the battle of the hills and the battle of the muck,</li>
<li>By the smoke it wasn't thick and the fire it was the hot,</li>
<li>They were throwing down the chute, for the fear of getting shot,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>Now nine years have over, if nothing took a ten,</li>
<li>Then I am safe back in the Lairoon again,</li>
<li>By the smoke it wasn't thick and the fire it was the hot,</li>
<li>They were throwing down the chute, for the fear of getting shot,</li>
<li>Musha doo, musha doo, what'd daddy do with 'em?</li>
<li>I got through that last verse, I got a big step there.</li>
<li>Oh, who's the one that's up there?</li>
<li>My father, Charlie Palmer.</li>
<li>What war was that?</li>
<li>Well, I think that was the Civil War.</li>
<li>No, I wouldn't be sure, but I'm pretty sure it was the Civil War.</li>
