<li>The month of August, one warm and sultry day, when from the west a gentle gale the wind</li>
<li>began to play. A fire was seen a-rising close by the railroad track, on the farm of one</li>
<li>little fellows in the town of Shandolack. It started going southward with many a dreadful</li>
<li>crash. Then, like a roaring demon, it went thundering through the slash. Oh, such a wild</li>
<li>fantastic sight I cannot well describe, as great red tongues of fire flashed from almost</li>
<li>every sight. The people of that neighborhood, like heroes brave and true, fought well to</li>
<li>protect their homes and help their neighbors too. Of every spark of enmity that might have</li>
<li>been before, in such a consternation was thought about no more. But where the fire was raging</li>
<li>were those heroes gathered round. There was not one to hang behind, among them to be found.</li>
<li>Both great and small were willing to give a helping hand and to keep the fire from burning</li>
<li>out the folks in Michigan. A little to the southward of a smoky section line, four settlers</li>
<li>were expecting far to have a dreadful time. And one of them, on seeing all the darkness</li>
<li>coming o'er, picked up his traps and started with his family to the shore. But the rest</li>
<li>of them, like heroes, stayed and temped to fight the fire and struggled to protect their</li>
<li>homes before they should retire. Although the fire was raging wild, those heroes did</li>
<li>not run, for he who left his property was burned completely down. He had no sonar left</li>
<li>his farm, his house was in a flame, and the splendid piece of grain he had, whose fate</li>
<li>was just the same. His loss was great, there's no mistake, and shocking it is to see how</li>
<li>soon a man may be reduced to want and misery. There was many a field of ripening grain and</li>
<li>many a stack of hay were swallowed by those raging flames on that destructive day. All</li>
<li>those raging elements have injured many the one. Look over the slash and there you'll</li>
<li>see the help that it has done, for now a man can go to work and clear a farm alone and</li>
<li>make himself in a few years a comfortable home. It won't be long, here you will see</li>
<li>the farmer with his fowl, busy in turning over the soil which is the slashing now, and</li>
<li>fields of grain will be harvested with pleasure and contempt, where not a stump will be in</li>
<li>sight the reaper to present. 'Twas thus the hand of Providence was working for the best,</li>
<li>if not to be felt at present in the future will be blessed, and as I conclude, and all</li>
<li>of us have gone to our repose, this dreary slashing will be seen to blossom as the rose.</li>
<li>What's your name? Louis Brighton. Brighton? How old are you? How old are you?</li>
<li>How old are you?</li>
