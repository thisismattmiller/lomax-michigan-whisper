<li>The young Canadian boy who left home and fell so dear, and longing for excitement to</li>
<li>Michigan this year.</li>
<li>In the space of three months after a telegram would come saying your boy has been killed</li>
<li>in the lumbering woods and his body will be sent home.</li>
<li>It's once I knew a charming lad, his name was Harry Dunn.</li>
<li>His father was a farmer in the township off of Dunn.</li>
<li>He had everything he wanted, a farm of good land, but he only wished to have the time</li>
<li>in the woods of Michigan.</li>
<li>He hired a lumbering king for the woods at Pecanine.</li>
<li>He worked away three long months or so, and all the time he stayed right home, singing</li>
<li>Sing soon, sing soon, sing soon, sing soon, sing soon, the winter will be o'er, and then</li>
<li>I will come home.</li>
<li>He rose one morning from his bunk, no smile could break his brow.</li>
<li>He called his chum outside the door, whose name was Charlie Lloyd, saying Charlie dear,</li>
<li>I had a dream which fills my heart with woe.</li>
<li>I fear there's something wrong at home, it's where I ought to go.</li>
<li>His comrade only laughed at him, stood him for a while, saying Charlie dear, it's time</li>
<li>to go, it's time to fall the pine.</li>
<li>They worked away till ten o'clock, all on that fatal day, when a hanging wing fell down</li>
<li>on him, which crushed him to the clay.</li>
<li>His comrades gathered round him to take him away, Charlie dear, my time has come, my</li>
<li>time has come right away, but you'll go down with me, Charlie, you'll take my body down,</li>
<li>and ask my dear old mother what made me leave my home.</li>
<li>The second morning after, his body was brought down, the coffin was brought down, containing</li>
<li>all that was left on the surface of the parade, and his mother, when she saw him, she fell</li>
<li>down like a stone.</li>
<li>The poor old aged father, he lingered for a while, but never, never afterwards, he never</li>
<li>was known to smile.</li>
<li>In the space of three months after, they bade the poor old man, So now you see the deadly</li>
<li>curse in the woods of Michigan.</li>
<li>Where did you learn that, Bert?</li>
<li>I got that, well that was in 1902, up here in Dollar Hill, see, there was a poem by the</li>
<li>name of Billy Coffee, working for the Danners, we were running camp for the Danners at the</li>
<li>time, and Billy Coffee sang that song, see, and that was in 1902, and I got down the first</li>
<li>words of it, see, and the first words of each line, and I kept flinging and getting it to</li>
<li>the, because he went along, see.</li>
<li>You learned it all the first time he sang it?</li>
<li>Yeah, yeah, the first, the first time that he sang it that I went, I never, I never heard</li>
<li>it afterwards, only I keep going over it myself, you know, and getting the lead from those</li>
<li>two letters that I--</li>
<li>I never heard it very many times after he was up with the Danners or something.</li>
<li>That was in 1902, Bill here was running camp for the Danners at the time.</li>
<li>Where were you, where did you come from originally, Bert?</li>
<li>I came from Canada.</li>
<li>Where?</li>
<li>Well I came from, well it's in Ontario, but I came from Orillia, a place called, well</li>
<li>I was born in Peterborough, Canada, but I later went to Orillia and worked in mills</li>
<li>and Grabenhurst and Bracebridge, and then I, I kept lingering up the line until I, I hit,</li>
<li>well I hit with an American company over there, see, and they brought me here.</li>
<li>They took me to a place called Simmons, see, at the back of Bovie on the Sioux line.</li>
<li>Were your people lumbering people too?</li>
<li>My father, my father was walking bus for the Rathbren company, that's the oldest company</li>
<li>that was in Canada.</li>
