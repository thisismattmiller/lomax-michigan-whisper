<li>Early in the season, the fall of '63, the preacher of the gospel one day come to me.</li>
<li>He says, My clever fellow, how would you like to go?</li>
<li>Far to spend a winter, a lumbering in Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Oh, so boldly I stepped up to him, these words to him did say.</li>
<li>And going out there, a lumbering depends upon the pay.</li>
<li>If you will pay good wages, my passage to and fro, I'll go spend a winter, a lumbering in Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Oh, if I will pay good wages, I'll pay your passage out, providing you sign papers that you will sail around.</li>
<li>Oh, but if you do get homesick and swear at home you'll go, I'll not pay your passage over to Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Oh, and by that kind of flattery we enlisted quite a train.</li>
<li>Oh, some twenty-five or thirty young able-bodied men.</li>
<li>Oh, we had a pleasant voyage on the road we had to go.</li>
<li>Oh, they landed us in Saginaw, Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Oh, it's now our joys are ended and the troubles they've begun.</li>
<li>Oh, Smith and Williams, they dance how they come rolling in.</li>
<li>Oh, they sent us in a country, the road we did not know.</li>
<li>Oh, it is up on the right for a river in Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Oh, they -- no, no, hold on a minute, I've got to stop it, I've got to stop it.</li>
<li>For to tell the way we suffered it is beyond the heart of man.</li>
<li>But to give the fair description I'll do the best I can.</li>
<li>Grubsy dogs, they'd laugh at our beds built on the snow.</li>
<li>Oh, God grant there is no bigger hell than Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Grubsy dogs, they'd laugh at our beds built on the snow.</li>
<li>Oh, God grant there is no bigger hell than Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Oh, it's now the winter is finished and it's homeward we are bound.</li>
<li>It's in this cursed country, no longer we'll be found.</li>
<li>We'll go home to our wives and sweethearts, tell others not to go.</li>
<li>To that God-forsaken country, yoke on Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>We'll go home to our wives and sweethearts, tell others not to go.</li>
<li>To that God-forsaken country, yoke on Michigan, I owe.</li>
<li>Where did you learn the song?</li>
<li>Oh, I learned it at Thomas Compton Saginaw and learned it to me.</li>
<li>How many years ago was that?</li>
<li>Oh, that's about 50 years ago.</li>
<li>60 years?</li>
<li>Yeah, 50 years ago.</li>
<li>Were you in the Lumberwood when you learned it?</li>
<li>Yes, I was.</li>
<li>And your name is Lester Wells?</li>
<li>Lester Wells.</li>
<li>Born and raised in?</li>
<li>Michigan.</li>
<li>Traverse City?</li>
<li>No, I wasn't born or raised in Traverse City.</li>
<li>I was born and raised in the south part of the state.</li>
<li>And I come here when I was six years old back.</li>
<li>And you're 82 now?</li>
<li>82 now.</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
