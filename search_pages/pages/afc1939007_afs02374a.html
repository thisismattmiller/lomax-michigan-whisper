<li>2374, A1 and 2.</li>
<li>I've got those 31st-level blues from my head down to my shoes.</li>
<li>In the morning, I go far around.</li>
<li>In the evening, I start as I frown.</li>
<li>When the boss comes down and says,</li>
<li>Get off those solos, Lowe.</li>
<li>Sure, sometimes, try to keep your rest.</li>
<li>Work makes my back itch.</li>
<li>And some days, it can outwit.</li>
<li>'Cause I've got those blues, those 31st-level blues.</li>
<li>I've got those solos from my head down to my shoes.</li>

<li>When did you compose this song?</li>
<li>Oh, 1931.</li>
<li>Oh, nice plan.</li>
<li>Well, it was an impromptu song,</li>
<li>composed on the mine.</li>
<li>What's all this about?</li>
<li>Tell me what kind of room it is.</li>
<li>Well, up in the three-and-four shaft</li>
<li>I had a really good boss there for that night,</li>
<li>so he was on something for that evening,</li>
<li>so it was sort of impromptu.</li>
<li>Who made it up?</li>
<li>I made it up on the job, the words and melodies.</li>
<li>Has it been going on for a long time?</li>
<li>It has been going on here for a long time.</li>
<li>Has it played for any of your friends over the years?</li>
<li>Not a lot of respect for it.</li>
<li>Hit it, hit it, hit it like that.</li>
<li>That's the tone of the brush.</li>
<li>And that's the tone of the bellows.</li>
<li>That's the tone of the bellows.</li>
