<li>2261, A1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>All right.</li>
<li>Oh, there was an old gentleman who invited last year his hobby was swimming right off</li>
<li>the St. Pierre.</li>
<li>He'd go in every morning when he felt rather sick to enjoy the salt water, show people</li>
<li>his perfection, went swimming so neat and combined his figure and muscle before and</li>
<li>behind.</li>
<li>He could out like a dove, come up like a cod, the ladies exclaiming a wonderful odd.</li>
<li>He would lay on his back for crabs, he would hunt and mimic the ladies to wash occur.</li>
<li>Close and neat and tidy, oh Christ the fair, with a beautiful figure, wash dark fuzzy hairs.</li>
<li>After swimming around and doing his best, he'd ride to the shore for a few moments,</li>
<li>rest full of water and wind to the shore.</li>
<li>He would start to enjoy the strange lecture by letting a fresh wave roll over him and</li>
<li>tickle his toes and blow out the dust from his fine homing nose.</li>
<li>Oh, gentleman, oh, gentleman, oh, what have you there, your body all naked, all covered</li>
<li>with hair?</li>
<li>The policeman is coming to stop us, as well, if he politely rolled over and showed them</li>
<li>his body, all naked, all covered with hair, great sight for the ladies who chance to stand</li>
<li>there.</li>
<li>Oh, the policeman is coming, but he showed them no quarters, he gave them the slip by</li>
<li>jumping into the waters.</li>
<li>They pursued him with boats, but he could them surpass, he would ride to the shore so that</li>
<li>the ladies his heart from a new wish would tickle them so, when they all cries at once,</li>
<li>let the old bastard go.</li>
<li>Oh, I've been a wildo beer for many long years, I spent all my money for whiskey and beer,</li>
<li>but now I will lay off my money and store, and I never will play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>Wildo beer, wildo beer, for many long years, but I never will play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>I put my hand in my pocket, I went to a tavern where I used to resort, and I told the landlady</li>
<li>my money was short, but my hat, she's not, yes I'm not, God damn it, that was my favorite.</li>
<li>I've been a wildo beer for many long years, I spent all my money for whiskey and beer,</li>
<li>but now I will lay off my money and store, and I never will play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>Wildo beer, wildo beer, for many long years, but I never will play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>Oh, I went to a tavern where I used to resort, and I told the landlady my money was short,</li>
<li>I asked her the pleasure on a place for your stay, and she told me such customers she had</li>
<li>every day, and though I ever no never no more, I never will play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>I put my hand in my pocket, a handful of gold did I drew, when scallops fly over the counter</li>
<li>I threw, sing I plant a pie of liquor and a plate you can stay, when your money grows</li>
<li>shine just go round this way, and though I never no never no more, I never will play</li>
<li>the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>Now the home to our parents has evolved times before, and I've asked them to forgive their</li>
<li>preradical sons, and I know they will do it for they've done it before, and I never will</li>
<li>play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>Wildo beer, wildo beer, wildo beer no more, I never will play the wildo beer no more.</li>
<li>I put my hand in my pocket, a handful of gold did I drew, when scallops fly over the counter</li>
<li>I threw, sing I plant a pie of liquor and a plate you can stay, when your money grows</li>
