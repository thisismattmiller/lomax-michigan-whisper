<li>2281A1 and 2.</li>
<li>After she walked out to take the air, and down by the rolling ocean, she met back the golden</li>
<li>air.</li>
<li>Consent, I'll send this heartless man, consent and be my bide; I'll send your body sinking down on the civil recline.</li>
<li>All that night on Henry's toe, he could not find no rest, for the thoughts of his dear Mary disturbed his aching rest.</li>
<li>And a day like the next morning, floating corpse he spied, as she was going to and fro upon the civil recline.</li>
<li>He knew it was his Mary by the gold ring on her hand, and when he undone the handkerchief, it brought him to a stand.</li>
<li>In the name of her base murderer, and letters where he spied, as she was going to and fro upon the civil recline.</li>
<li>And the villain was found guilty, and the gallows was his doom, for the murdering of her dear Mary, who was scarcely in her womb.</li>
<li>And young Henry lamented, Uncle, his poor heart is break, and his last word was my Mary, who died off for my sake.</li>
<li>I walked out one evening in the merry month of May, down by a flowery garden where besties heeded strain.</li>
<li>Finally over, heard a fair maid in sorrow did complain, of her youthful lover who fells her aging name.</li>
<li>I stepped up to this fair maid, and I took her by surprise.</li>
<li>I only did not know, before I was in disguise.</li>
<li>I said, My charming Jew, my giant heart's light, how far have you to travel this dark and rainy night?</li>
<li>I must start the way to Cloddy, would you be pleased to so? And take pity on the poor distracted maid, for I have to go.</li>
<li>I must search of a hapless young man, and Johnny is his name, and on the banks of Cloddy, I'm told he does remain.</li>
<li>Although through the banks of Cloddy, where in you now to stand?</li>
<li>And don't you believe young Johnny, for he's a false young man?</li>
<li>You cannot believe young Johnny, for he won't meet you here.</li>
<li>But carry with me to yonder woods, no danger need you fear. If Johnny was here tonight, he would keep me from all harm.</li>
<li>But he's in the field of battle, after children all in his uniform. He's in the field of battle, and his foe he does defy, like some ruling king up on earth that fought in the wars of pride.</li>
<li>And if six long weeks are better, then sure Johnny's left the shore. He is cruising the main ocean, where the foaming billows roar.</li>
<li>He is cruising the main ocean, for honor and for gain. His ship was wrecked, all hands were lost up on the coast of Spain.</li>
<li>When she heard this dreadful news, she fell into despair, with the ringing of her hands and the tearing of her hair, of her hair, of her hair.</li>
<li>Since he's gone, he's gone, and with me no other man I'll take. If it's true some lonesome rally, I don't wonder what he'll say.</li>
<li>He, he, he couldn't no longer stand. He fell into horror and sang, Bessie, I'm the man.</li>
<li>I am that, I am that, I am that, half this young man that caused you all your pain, caused you all your pain.</li>
<li>And he said, If we had met on Claudie's back, we'd have never parted the gate, never parted the gate, never parted the gate.</li>
<li>Oh, yes, I think so. Of course, I ain't sure what I imagine it is.</li>
<li>Oh, we're in a different age now, you know.</li>
<li>Yeah, the girls now is nothing like even what they were in my young days, in my time. You know what I mean? They're all together different.</li>
<li>You'd never see a girl going into a tavern or smoking a cigarette or drinking a glass of beer, them days.</li>
<li>But what about their loyalty to them? I think they were more loyal in them days.</li>
<li>See how that is sound now.</li>
