<li>- 2292B.</li>
<li>- The dark was when my coal blew up in amphic leaf all the rain.</li>
<li>And Eliza left her own dear home for her nerd to return again.</li>
<li>She left her tender mother's side, not fearing wind or cold.</li>
<li>For she was young and fair to view, but love that made her bold.</li>
<li>At 10 o'clock that very night, down by the old oak tree,</li>
<li>she promised James her own true love that with them she would be.</li>
<li>See, he knocked the wrenching rain, or the ocean clouded roar.</li>
<li>But through a cloak he bowed her neck, stepped quickly from the door.</li>
<li>That night passed on, and morning came, and Eliza was not home.</li>
<li>And how much it grieved her friends to think where Eliza was a good home.</li>
<li>At length the neighbors started out to search the country from three grounds.</li>
<li>Oh, I'll search the country all around, till I find my darling child.</li>
<li>For three long weeks the people spent in searching the country round.</li>
<li>But their search was all in vain, and Eliza was not found.</li>
<li>This grieved old mother, she came home, and this grieved old mother cried.</li>
<li>Then broken hearted, and she lay down, and broken hearted died.</li>
<li>By to the scene of all this play, and owner of the ground.</li>
<li>And Squire McCullough came one day to hunt with horse and hound.</li>
<li>Uphill, down dale, the earth did roar with their gallows company.</li>
<li>And the dogs by chance they lost their box, down by the old oak tree.</li>
<li>The dogs began to root and tear, and dig away the clay.</li>
<li>And all those gentlemen could do was to keep those dogs away.</li>
<li>And McCullough dismounted and called for pick and spade.</li>
<li>They dug the ground, and there they found that missing murder's name.</li>
<li>To see that grave give up its dead, it was a hard sight.</li>
<li>To see the worms had picked out those eyes, that one was blue and bright.</li>
<li>And her breast at once was dazzling, white was black with wounds and blows.</li>
<li>And from her breast, fresh, it dropped a bug, came the scene to her clothes.</li>
<li>Oh, I to the scene of all this on end.</li>
<li>I've done the deed, McCullough cried, my soul is fit for hell.</li>
<li>Come, hide her cold corpse from my eyes, after I've left it to go to hell.</li>
<li>I own, I loved Eliza once, but with a devil's heart, the devil whispered,</li>
<li>Take her life, and then you will be free, then I will try my dinner cup,</li>
<li>dinner cup, dinner cup, dinner cup, dinner cup.</li>
