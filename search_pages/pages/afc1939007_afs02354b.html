<li>In Scarlet Town where I was born, there was a fair maid dweller, made every youth cry</li>
<li>well away, and her name was Barbielum.</li>
<li>It was all in the month of June, the green buds they were blooming, sweet William, on</li>
<li>his death bed lay, for the love of Barbielum.</li>
<li>He sent his servants to the town where Barbara was a dweller, your master sick and sent for</li>
<li>you, if your name be Barbielum, so slowly, slowly she got up, slowly she went up, slowly</li>
<li>she went down, and all she said when she got there, young man I think you're dying, oh</li>
<li>yes I'm sick, very sick, death on me is dwelling, no better, no better, I know she'll be, if</li>
<li>I can't have Barbielum, oh yes you're sick, very sick, death on you is dwelling, no better,</li>
<li>no better, you never shall be, for you can't have Barbielum, as she was on her highway</li>
<li>home, the birds they kept singing, they sang so clear and seemed to say hard hearted Barbielum,</li>
<li>she looked to the east, looked to the west, find his corpse a-coming, lay down, lay down,</li>
<li>that corpse a-play, that I may look upon him, the more she looked, the more she wept, so</li>
<li>slowly she went, not me, oh mother, oh mother go make my bed, make it long and narrow, sweet</li>
<li>Barbielum died for pure, pure love, that I shall die for sorrow, she was very fair in</li>
<li>the old churchyard, and he was very nigh her, on William's grave, there grew, there grew,</li>
<li>there grew, there grew, there grew, there grew, there grew, red rose, red rose, red rose,</li>
<li>on Barbara's grave green, but they grew and grew, they could not grow no higher, so they</li>
<li>found themselves in the cool of night, red rose, rose, rose, rose, rose, rose, red rose.</li>
