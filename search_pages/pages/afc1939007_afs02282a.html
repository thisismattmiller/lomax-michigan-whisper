<li>2282A.</li>
<li>It was in the town of Wexford, where I was a bread-and-born,</li>
<li>and in the town of Athlone I found a flour mill.</li>
<li>It was there I courted a Wexford girl with a dark and a rolling eye,</li>
<li>and I promised I would wed her eff with the knee she would comply.</li>
<li>I went one night to her sister's house about eight o'clock at night,</li>
<li>and I asked her for to take a walk our wedding day to pine.</li>
<li>We walked along quite come early till we came to level ground.</li>
<li>Then I pulled the stake out from the edge, and I knocked the spare one down,</li>
<li>and down upon her bended knees she pleaded for her life.</li>
<li>'Oh, Johnny dear, don't kill me here, I am not prepared to die.'</li>
<li>I never let onto heat her, but it heat her all the more,</li>
<li>until the ground around her was in a bloody gore.</li>
<li>Then I took her by the yellow locks, and I dragged her for the ground,</li>
<li>and I threw her in the water that runs through Wexford town.</li>
<li>'Lie there, lie there, you Wexford girl, to me you'll never be tied.'</li>
<li>'Lie there, lie there, you Wexford girl, you'll never will be my bride.'</li>
<li>It was about nine days after this lovely maid was found,</li>
<li>a-floating in the water that runs through Wexford town.</li>
<li>And everyone that seen her said she was a lovely bride.</li>
<li>She was fitting for a lawyer, or in need a duke beside.</li>
<li>I was taken on suspicion, and to jail straightway were sent.</li>
<li>There was known to intercede for me, and I want to go my bail.</li>
<li>Her sisters swore my life away without either fear or doubt,</li>
<li>for well they knew, and well they knew that night I took her out.</li>
<li>Oh, I went straight home to my mother's house about nine o'clock at night,</li>
<li>and whooped my mother out of her sleep, which gave her an awful fright.</li>
<li>'Oh, son, dear son, what have you done? What has blooded your handsome clothes?'</li>
<li>And the answer that I made her was a bleeding from the nose.</li>
<li>'Now, come all you jolly young fellows, I warning take by me,</li>
<li>and never treat your own true love with cruel severity.</li>
<li>For if you do, you'll surely rue until the day you die.</li>
<li>You'll be hung like me, a murderer up on the hillside.'</li>
