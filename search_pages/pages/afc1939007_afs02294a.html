<li>2294 A 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>He was headed up north to tell me the voice of that bounteous treasure of gasoline.</li>
<li>There were five brave men, whose names I will tell, for their glory is yet unknown.</li>
<li>There was Everett and Bruce and Liam so true, with Raymond and Staple, Captain Hill.</li>
<li>When they arrived at the boys, the crowd was worked, for there were many tanks to be filled.</li>
<li>They knew not the fate that was soon to come from that gasoline aboard that boat.</li>
<li>They were filling the belts when the blast occurred, which threw them all into eternity.</li>
<li>When the coast guards arrived, they did find it in flames, and they knew that all were lost that day.</li>
<li>There were five brave men lost their lives that day, so take heed to my warning now.</li>
<li>All you young women who love your sailors true, don't let them sail as salvagers.</li>
<li>This one here, oh, just a bunch put together.</li>
<li>Everett and Macaulay.</li>
<li>I didn't suppose that.</li>
<li>What was the boat's name again?</li>
<li>304, that was a boat out in Maryland.</li>
<li>Who was the boat's name?</li>
<li>Everett and Macaulay.</li>
<li>Oh, just a bunch of it stuck together.</li>
<li>What's your name?</li>
<li>Everett and Macaulay.</li>
<li>Me? I'm 15.</li>
<li>They sent me to America, my fortune for to cry.</li>
<li>I was shipwrecked on the Austrian that now lies on the bay.</li>
<li>But Prophet Innswood wrote to me, and a plank brought me on shore.</li>
<li>I'm in hope to see my own true love.</li>
<li>Innsweep retails once more.</li>
<li>It was on the morning of the fourth, just by the break of the day.</li>
<li>A handsome ferret made steps up to me, and was to me to say.</li>
<li>Where are you from, my nice young man?</li>
<li>Come quickly, tell to me.</li>
<li>Where are you from the heavens above? Where is your country?</li>
<li>Oh, I am a stranger in this place, the truth I will tell you.</li>
<li>And for loving of a pretty fair maiden, the town of sweeper tail.</li>
<li>And because I had Richard Grayton, she was of a low degree.</li>
<li>It caused my parents for to frown, which proved my destiny.</li>
<li>Oh, come tell me, are you married to that girl you left behind?</li>
<li>No, but I'm already promised, and a promise that's good in kind.</li>
<li>I am already promised to that girl in sweeper tail.</li>
<li>And except for no other fair maid will ever my favor regain.</li>
<li>And this fair maid felt a weeping in, that here goes down her seat.</li>
<li>Oh, here is twenty guineas and gold, for to bear you o'er the sea.</li>
<li>For I find that love is better far than gold and earthly store.</li>
<li>Oh, may they, heavens, they above, for I can't get you love.</li>
<li>Oh, sweet Richard, you want more.</li>
<li>[inaudible]</li>
<li>Oh, where did that come from? Did you have any idea about it?</li>
<li>Some of it you remember these songs so well I don't remember where you left them.</li>
<li>[inaudible]</li>
<li>Was a rich man, lived in the town.</li>
<li>And he was the man of a high renown.</li>
<li>He had one daughter, a beauty bride.</li>
<li>And the name he called her was his heart's delight.</li>
<li>There was many rich lards courting her came.</li>
<li>But none of them could her favor gain.</li>
<li>And there came a young man of a low degree, and above them all was she a fancy maid.</li>
<li>And when her father came this to know, that she had loved this young man so.</li>
<li>Oh, many miles he sent her away, for to detain her on her wedding day.</li>
<li>And one night as she was for her bed bound, as she was taking off her gown,</li>
<li>she heard a voice of a deadly sound, saying break the bond, the love that we have bound.</li>
<li>And her mother's man told her she knew right well.</li>
<li>And her father's deed she could plainly tell.</li>
<li>She dressed herself in a rich attire, and now she's off with her heart's desire.</li>
<li>And he said, my darling, get on behind.</li>
<li>And the road more swift than any wine, and for half an hour or a little more.</li>
<li>And he said, my darling, my head's going slow.</li>
<li>And a white hauling handkerchief she then pulled out, and with it wrapped his head about,</li>
<li>kissed his lips, and those words did say, oh, my love, you're colder than any clay.</li>
<li>Then when they came to her father's gate, lie down, my darling, lie down and rest.</li>
<li>Oh, lie down, darling, and go to bed, and I'll see your horse in the stable's bed.</li>
<li>Then early next morning a flimsy night arose, until the churchyard she quickly goes.</li>
<li>And although her true love was the nine months dead,</li>
<li>her white hauling handkerchief was tied around his head.</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
