<li>- 2287, A1 and two.</li>
<li>Oh, why you think my bonnie laughs</li>
<li>After you leave that careless father, oh</li>
<li>He has to keep you and friends and brits</li>
<li>And all two together</li>
<li>Gladly, father, do adieu</li>
<li>Father, do adieu, gladly, father, do adieu</li>
<li>Oh</li>
<li>Oh, this old man and this old wife</li>
<li>They shucked the dust together, oh</li>
<li>And I have Robin Thompson's pet</li>
<li>And he has a gut, my mother, gladly, father, do adieu</li>
<li>Gladly, father, do adieu</li>
<li>Father, do adieu, gladly, father, do adieu</li>
<li>But there's a verse there that,</li>
<li>where they made a swap between his wife and the girl.</li>
<li>- Well, I don't understand that.</li>
<li>It's part of that song.</li>
<li>- Well, this old Robin, the black man had a</li>
<li>had a wife, and this was his daughter, see?</li>
<li>So he created a girl for the mother.</li>
<li>So you take Robin Thompson's pet,</li>
<li>and I will take your mother, okay?</li>
<li>Well, I'll think of that tomorrow and put you on it.</li>
<li>- Hell, I didn't think of that goddamn song 40 years ago.</li>
<li>Down in Fair and Bony Scotland where</li>
<li>They blew bells, they blew gold</li>
<li>And handsome, very hardy sheep</li>
<li>Down on the low and low</li>
<li>And many a happy hour she spent</li>
<li>Upon the banks of the Clyde</li>
<li>Although her luck and life was low</li>
<li>She was called the Iblis Clyde</li>
<li>And one day young Henry, he came there</li>
<li>Young Henry was a pilanderer</li>
<li>He came there too, all once a day</li>
<li>He hunted all around the place</li>
<li>Where Mary's cock did away</li>
<li>And many a beaming eye cast on Mary's kite fair</li>
<li>He wondered why so fair a flower</li>
<li>Could bloom and flourish there</li>
<li>And one day young Henry, he came home</li>
<li>His face decked with woe</li>
<li>St. Mary, lovely Mary</li>
<li>It is from you I must go</li>
<li>Our regiment has got their out</li>
<li>And I receive command</li>
<li>And I must forsake those low landshades</li>
<li>For Indians burning sand</li>
<li>And he said my dearest Mary</li>
<li>Hey, if you will come with me</li>
<li>And before we leave for Scotland tomorrow we will be</li>
