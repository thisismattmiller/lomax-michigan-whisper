<li>2277A. There was an old trooper in London did well. He had but one daughter, a very fine girl. And for riches a beauty known could her excel, and she swore that she'd marry a trooper.</li>
<li>Oh, Father, I ain't torn, I am the dire. Then again, a tailor, he did live close by. On this pretty lass he cast a bright eye. And five hundred guineas he would freely give or purchase.</li>
<li>Yes, that's the wife of the trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire. Oh, yes, Mr. Taylor, I think you are right. My husband the trooper is on duty tonight.</li>
<li>But if he does come, he will give us a fright. You will hear the loud knock of the trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>The trooper came home about twelve o'clock, and at the door he loudly did knock. Oh, hide me for God's sake. The tailor did cry, for I hear the loud knock of the trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>Oh, there is an old cupboard, it stands on the floor, and if you go there you'll be safe and secure. Until I go downstairs and open the door and welcome my husband the trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>Oh, husband, dear husband, if you, oh. Oh, husband, dear husband, there is no trembling stuff. If you jump to bed you'll be soon warm enough.</li>
<li>Oh, there is an old cupboard, it stands on the floor, and I'll burn it tonight. There's a trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire. Oh, husband, dear husband, would you grant my desire?</li>
<li>I think that old cupboard is too good for fire, but in it I keep a gamecock I admire. Well, we'll see your gamecock. There's a trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>The trooper went up to the old cupboard door. He hit it a kick, and it fell on the floor. Oh, ten thousand martyrs, the tailor did cry. Is this your gamecock? There's a trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>Then off the tailor he took a pair of sharp shears. That day he did him well and cut off both his ears. Then back over sideways he kicked him downstairs. You're not half a gamecock to the trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>You're not half a gamecock to the trooper, and for the dire, and for the dire.</li>
<li>[Silence]</li>
