<li>A.F.S. recording, number 2343, side B.</li>
<li>Hello, my friends, whoever you might be, ladies and gentlemen, children or elders.</li>
<li>If you'd like to hear the real story of what happened to me in Gennady, in the Dictator Lumberhood.</li>
<li>I went to the booth and I dropped my little rope, and down the chow to get some cover for me both.</li>
<li>In the hoof, the yoodle-do-do-do-do-do, in the hoof, the yoodle-do-do-do.</li>
<li>I hit her in the gitz and I hit her in the hoe, I hit her in the off-space, out against the hall.</li>
<li>In the hoof, the yoodle-do-do-do-do-do-do, in the hoof, the yoodle-do-do-do-do.</li>
<li>I hit her in the anvil and the anvil would ring, but I ran against him and ding-a-ling-a-ling.</li>
<li>In the hoof, the yoodle-do-do-do-do-do, in the hoof, the yoodle-do-do-do-do.</li>
<li>When I got done, he called me a kid. Now he says, Remember me because I did, I did.</li>
<li>Hoofty yoodle-do-do-da-do-do-do, hofty yoodle-do-do-do.</li>
<li>Nine three days after I was out of the store,</li>
<li>I picked up a bottle of rye, all on to the sinker.</li>
<li>Hoofty yoodle-do-do-do-do-do, hofty yoodle-do-do-do-do.</li>
<li>Nine days after I had no ball at all,</li>
<li>don't give one sunglass in the two blue balls,</li>
<li>hofty yoodle-do-do-do-do, hofty yoodle-do-do-do.</li>
<li>When I stopped this town, I got money in my pocket,</li>
<li>but then I'm on the pick and I haven't got no cent.</li>
<li>This town ain't no place for men without the money,</li>
<li>so back in the camp in the morning I am bent.</li>
<li>Hofty yoodle-do-do-do-do-do, hofty yoodle-do-do-do.</li>
