<li>2356B.</li>
<li>B.</li>
<li>There's not one on the river McCluskey did fear,</li>
<li>As he swung his gourd stick or the big spotted steer.</li>
<li>They were round, plump and handsome,</li>
<li>Girting nine foot and three,</li>
<li>As McCluskey the Scotchman,</li>
<li>You're the laddies for me.</li>
<li>It's next came Bull Garden, though skidding was full,</li>
<li>As he hollowed woe harsh to his little brown bull.</li>
<li>They were short-legged and shaggy,</li>
<li>Girting six foot and nine,</li>
<li>Two lights as a foreman to handle the pine.</li>
<li>It's three to the thousand,</li>
<li>Our contract is called,</li>
<li>Our hauling is good and the timber is tall.</li>
<li>McCluskey declared far to make his day full,</li>
<li>That he would skid to the one of those little brown bulls.</li>
<li>Oh, it's now, says Bull Garden, that you cannot do,</li>
<li>Though I well know your steers are the pet of the crew.</li>
<li>But you'll find out, my laddy, you'll have your hands full,</li>
<li>If you skid one more log than those little brown bulls.</li>
<li>The day was appointed and the time it drew near,</li>
<li>For twenty-five dollars their fortunes to try,</li>
<li>Both eager and anxious the morning it found,</li>
<li>The judges and scalers all there on the ground.</li>
<li>With a hoop and a hollow came McCluskey in view,</li>
<li>With his big spotted steers the pet of the crew,</li>
<li>Saying to your cougs lively and keep your jaws full,</li>
<li>You can easily beat those little brown bulls.</li>
<li>Says McCluskey to Sandy, we'll take off their skin,</li>
<li>We will dig them a grave and we'll tumble them in,</li>
<li>We will learn the damn Yankees to face the bull scotch,</li>
<li>We will mix them a dose and we'll feed it to them hard.</li>
<li>It's next came Bull Garden with a pipe in his jaw,</li>
<li>With his little brown bulls whelped a good in each jaw,</li>
<li>It was little did they think when they saw him come down,</li>
<li>That a hundred and forty he would turn around.</li>
<li>Oh, it's now says Bull Garden with blood in his eye,</li>
<li>This day we're to conquer McCluskey or die,</li>
<li>Says John to Bull Garden, you need never fear,</li>
<li>For you will never be beat by those big spotted steers,</li>
<li>The sun had gone down when our foreman did say,</li>
<li>Turn out boys, turn out you've done enough for today,</li>
<li>We have counted and scaled them each man to our team,</li>
<li>It's well do we know which man pips the beam,</li>
<li>Supper was over when McCluskey did appear,</li>
<li>With a belt ready made for those big spotted steers,</li>
<li>And to make a teetotum his best machina,</li>
<li>He was found he'd conducted according to law,</li>
<li>When up steps the scaler says hold you a while,</li>
<li>Your big spotted steers are behind just a mile,</li>
<li>For you skidded a hundred and ten and no more,</li>
<li>While the garden did beat you by ten and a score,</li>
<li>The boys they did shout and McCluskey did swear,</li>
<li>As he tore out in handful his long yellow hair,</li>
<li>Says McCluskey to Garden, my money I'll pull,</li>
<li>And the belt to make he bar those little brown bulls, bulls, bulls, bulls.</li>
