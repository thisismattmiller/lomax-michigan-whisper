<li>(A couple of classy bums and you'll complain they say)</li>
<li>(We haven't got a nickel and we're happy as can be)</li>
<li>(We haven't any bridges and we haven't any care)</li>
<li>(So we'd rather be a couple of bums and a couple of millionaires)</li>
<li>(Now we're proud to say we never worked nor never never will)</li>
<li>(And when our cause begins to go there's plenty of souls lying still)</li>
<li>(Our faces show no function, we more than get our share)</li>
<li>(So we'd rather be a couple of bums and a couple of millionaires)</li>
<li>(Now with faith we love to sleep all night and sleep beneath a tree)</li>
<li>(And listen to the humming of the songbirds and the bees)</li>
<li>(We like to dream of millions and build castles in the air)</li>
<li>(We'd rather be a couple of bums and a couple of millionaires)</li>
<li>(Now it's when you meet a millionaire he'll always pass you by)</li>
<li>(His thinking of his troubles and the tears are in his eyes)</li>
<li>(His face has lines of burrows and the gray is in his hair)</li>

<li>(His face has lines of burrows and the gray is in his hair)</li>
<li>(We'd rather be a couple of bums and a couple of millionaires)</li>
<li>(Now if we happen to get paid as bums they all time do)</li>
<li>(They've got to feed us in the jail, now folks you know that's true)</li>
<li>(We don't even have to work in jail for we don't think it's fair)</li>
<li>(We'd rather be a couple of bums and a couple of millionaires)</li>
<li>(We're just a bunch of furnace men as you can plainly see)</li>
<li>(We haven't got a nickel and we're happy as can be)</li>
<li>(We haven't any release and we haven't any care)</li>
<li>(We'd rather be a furnace man than a millionaire)</li>
<li>(Now it's when you meet the furnace man he'll never pass you by)</li>
<li>(His thinking of his old buggies and the tears are in his eyes)</li>
<li>(His face is full of war dust and there's charcoal in his hair)</li>
<li>(We'd rather be a furnace man than a millionaire)</li>
<li>(Now we love to fiddle around the night before the fire)</li>
<li>(And start to tell stories and see who's the biggest liar)</li>
<li>(We like to dream of millions and build castles in the air)</li>
<li>(We'd rather be a furnace man than a millionaire)</li>
<li>(Now if we happen to come late as furnace men all time do)</li>
<li>(They've got to go to the bottom, boy you know that's true)</li>
<li>(He don't like to have us late at all for he doesn't think it's fair)</li>
<li>(So we'd rather be a furnace man than a millionaire)</li>
<li>(Do you remember where you learned that purple bomb song?)</li>
<li>(Well I learned it from my nephew, I don't know him)</li>
<li>(How long ago?)</li>
<li>(That's about 12 years, 10-12 years ago, about the same time as I left you)</li>
<li>(I left you, I left you, I left you, I left you)</li>
<li>(upbeat music)</li>
