<li>As I went to walk in one fine summer's evening to review the green field, as I strolled along,</li>
<li>I spied an old man in a sad lamentation. He was rocking the cradle and this was his song.</li>
<li>And they told him, No, baby lies he, for indeed your own daddy shall never be known,</li>
<li>for he's weeping, he's wailing, he's rocking the cradle, pleasing the baby and the child not his own.</li>
<li>When I first fell in love with your innocent mother, like an old fool, thought I was blessed with a wife.</li>
<li>But through all my misdeeds and through my misfortunes, for I'm born to be played in the days of my life.</li>
<li>For it's odd, no, baby lies he, for indeed your own daddy shall never be known, for he's weeping, he's wailing, he's rocking the cradle,</li>
<li>and pleasing the baby and the child not his own.</li>
<li>When the evening comes on, she is off to some party, she will leave me to sing and to rock all alone.</li>
<li>But the innocent baby, she'll call me her daddy, but little she knows, I'm never so.</li>
<li>For it's odd, no, baby lies he, for indeed your own daddy shall never be known, for he's weeping, he's wailing, he's rocking the cradle,</li>
<li>and pleasing the baby and the child not his own.</li>
<li>Now come all you young men, if you want to get married, I'll pray you take warning and leave women alone.</li>
<li>For the by the lord, Harry, you ever get married, you'll be rocking the cradle and the child not your own.</li>
<li>For it's odd, no, baby lies he, for indeed your own daddy shall never be known, for he's weeping, he's wailing, he's rocking the cradle,</li>
<li>and pleasing the baby and the child not his own.</li>
<li>Most hilarious.</li>
