<li>One night I came home to my kitty from roving the country around.</li>
<li>The wine made me jovial and witty, so I carefully sat myself down.</li>
<li>I then put my hand in my pocket, my cash I gave to her to count.</li>
<li>And Kitty, you see, was no blockhead. She quickly told me the amount.</li>
<li>Then, Johnny, she says, I've been thinking what I would reveal unto you.</li>
<li>If you would only refrain from your drinking, we would soon be as rich as the Jews.</li>
<li>For whiskey's the root of all evil, of all evil, discussions and woes.</li>
<li>The edges and the fornicator were made to such people compared.</li>
<li>If women were to preach the gospel, I surely would get you the gown.</li>
<li>But Paul, the great saint and apostle, the doctrines of all he set down.</li>
<li>Saying women were sent as a guardian, being told not to preach but to pray.</li>
<li>When Adam was into the garden, it was a woman that led him astray.</li>
<li>When Paul ordered wine up to Timothy, it made him both wholesome and sound.</li>
<li>When Noah came first from the ark shore, he drank till he lay on the ground.</li>
<li>So it's none of your scriptural phrases, won't put between me and my glass.</li>
<li>I drink it with two pounds of reason. I'm neither a mule or a heart.</li>
<li>And it's all you can say about whiskey is nothing but old women's talk.</li>
<li>For it keeps you detected from thinking. It helps the poor traveler to walk.</li>
<li>It keeps off both grief and vexation and banishes sorrow and woe.</li>
<li>It gives the blood free circulation and makes it most rapidly flow.</li>
<li>Oh gosh, I learned it from when I was just young.</li>
<li>First went to work in the woods, went to work in the woods, went to work in the woods, went to work in the woods, went to work in the woods.</li>
<li>I don't remember who I first heard saying that.</li>
<li>Oh yes, yes, at that time.</li>
