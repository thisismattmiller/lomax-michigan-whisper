<li>Oh, you gallant, so 80 of country and city, I hope you will pity a languishing maid, that</li>
<li>has sadly perplexed and sorely vexed at all by her old husband, I've worked he was dead.</li>
<li>He's frantic and crazy, lame, sleepy and lazy, and all the night over he coughs and he bawls,</li>
<li>crying, Jenny, my honey, you feel very funny, I wish you'd lie over a way to the wall.</li>
<li>Oh, it was the first night that I went to bed to him, I longed for the pleasures that granny told</li>
<li>me. Instead of fun kisses that would crown my wishes, I clasped my arm, drowning me big into</li>
<li>the ball, crying, Jenny, my honey, you feel very funny, I wish you'd lie over a way to the wall.</li>
<li>Oh, this doting old miser, that ramped out of nature, his shins are as sharp as the edge of a knife, in his</li>
<li>balls he's as cold as the snow on the mountain, to stand more in need of a nurse and a wife.</li>
<li>That's now to conclude, and to finish my ditty, I wish I had been some lumberjack's bride,</li>
<li>found my bubbits and sew his leg over me, then I'd have pleasure at every call.</li>
<li>Oh, I learned this in the upper country, way up on the Pate River.</li>
<li>How long ago? Oh, better than 40 years ago. What's your name? My name is Newstick, Martin Newstick.</li>
<li>You live here in Coffin City? I do, and it's always been my hometown ever since I was a kid.</li>
<li>Are you Irish? No, I ain't. My mother was half Irish and half Scotch, and my father was a full-blooded Englishman.</li>
<li>That's the three dirty mixtures of the world. And how old are you? Well, sir, I'll be 66 years old on the third day of October.</li>
<li>Was there a love camp in Laugh? Oh, I put in a few days, had a few leaves, and went off.</li>
<li>You were one of the people that knew Paul Bunyan best. Oh, yes, yeah, I was with Paul when he put in the pictured rocks up on the upper peninsula and dug the hole for Lake Superior.</li>
<li>Yeah, I was with him the time when we'd run out of timber. He had to go west, and we started farming there. We had nothing else to do.</li>
<li>And we cleared off a big chunk of ground, and Paul went out west to look up some more timber.</li>
<li>And when he'd come back, the potatoes was all ready to dig, you know, nice, great big tops and the ground was covered.</li>
<li>Paul went out, he thought he'd see how the potatoes were coming out, and he dug a hole on the side of one hill and thought he'd bust the potatoes rolled out before he could plug the hole.</li>
<li>And there's a large one down below, he says, 'Beat James, and I'll peel them all for supper.'</li>
<li>Oh, God, but that did tickle me when I was a little bit jumped on his horn. He says, 'That's the truth.' He says, 'I can prove it for I peeled the potatoes.'</li>
