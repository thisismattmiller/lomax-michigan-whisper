<li>A.F.S. recording number two, three, four, six, side A.</li>
<li>So scripts one and two.</li>
<li>Now, my friends, whoever you might be, English, Irish, or Scottish,</li>
<li>I'm going to give you a little song. It's a Finnish cavalry.</li>
<li>It's in a Finnish language, but it's called A Freedom for Protestants.</li>
<li>[Singing in Finnish]</li>
<li>Thank Lord it is so.</li>
<li>One early Monday morning in eighteen hundred and five,</li>
<li>I thought myself quite lucky to find myself alive.</li>
<li>I harnessed up my horses, my business to pursue.</li>
<li>I went to Hollywood as I used for to do.</li>
<li>The alehouse, it was open and the liquor, it was free.</li>
<li>When one glass was empty and another filled for me,</li>
<li>I only hollered one load in the room of hauling four.</li>
<li>I got so drunk that lower town I couldn't haul no more.</li>
<li>I put the saddle on the back and started for the barn.</li>
<li>I saddled up old Graham not thinking any harm.</li>
<li>I saddled up old Graham, I rode away so still.</li>
<li>I scarcely drew my breath until I came to Stony Hill.</li>
<li>I met an old companion, his name I dare not tell.</li>
<li>He told me when and where there was going to be a ball.</li>
<li>I were hard to be persuaded, but at last we did agree</li>
<li>to go to the spot where the fiddler was to be.</li>
<li>Then four of us green mountain boys got on the floor to dance.</li>
<li>All in a hurry on the fiddler we did advance.</li>
<li>Fiddler being so willing and his ironing, ironing, ironing, ironing</li>
<li>for four hours long.</li>
<li>Oh, the fiddler being so willing and his ironing so strong</li>
<li>played the reeds of old Ireland for four hours, four hours, four hours, four hours.</li>
<li>(static crackling)</li>
