<li>AFS recording number 2328, side A.</li>
<li>We rode them straight on shore.</li>
<li>Within about six months tailing, we struck the African shore.</li>
<li>Oh, we captured 1,800 of those men from their naked land we board.</li>
<li>We marched them straight across our deck and towed them well below.</li>
<li>It was 18 inches till the men was all they had to go.</li>
<li>We hiked our anchor, then sought tail with our cargo of slaves.</li>
<li>It would have been better for their poor souls if they'd been in their graves.</li>
<li>Oh, the placid beaver came on board, took half of them away.</li>
<li>We dragged their bodies across our deck and pulled them in the sea.</li>
<li>Within about three months tailing, we struck the Cubian shore.</li>
<li>We sold them to the planters to be slayed forevermore.</li>
<li>Oh, the rice and coffee fields to hold beneath the burning sun.</li>
<li>Totally day hard and a wretched life until their career was run.</li>
<li>And when our money was all gone, we were forced to go to sea.</li>
<li>Our captain then he came on board and this to me did say,</li>
<li>There is gold and jewels in store for us if you rest me remain.</li>
<li>We'll hoist a loft, our pirate flag and we'll scour the Spanish main.</li>
<li>Oh, we all consented but by brave lads we rode them straight to land.</li>
<li>Two of them was Boston boys and two from Newfoundland.</li>
<li>One of them was an Irish lad belonging to Trimor.</li>
<li>I wished a god I had joined those youths and went with them on board.</li>
<li>Oh, we robbed and plundered many a ship down on that Spanish main.</li>
<li>And the many poor would have an orphan child we left in sorrow to remain.</li>
<li>Oh, we forced their crews to walk the plank, gave them a watery grave.</li>
<li>And the saying of our captain was, That dead man tells no tales.</li>
<li>Oh, we were chased by many a ship, both liners and frigates too.</li>
<li>And many a Spanish man of war that we and many a Spanish war who asked us to try to.</li>
<li>Oh, we were chased by many a ship, both liners and frigates too.</li>
<li>And many a Spanish war you just try to subdue.</li>
