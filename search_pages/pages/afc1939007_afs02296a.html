<li>2296, A1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>As I went a-walking one morning into May,</li>
<li>I went,</li>
<li>to Willie's chamber, and we'll find anything.</li>
<li>Rise up, my old comrade, and let nobody know,</li>
<li>it's a fine summer morning, and a bathing will go.</li>
<li>And we walked along together, and they came to a lane.</li>
<li>And who did they meet, but the keeper of the game?</li>
<li>He advised young Willie for to not venture in,</li>
<li>to the deep and cold waters on the lake top of Colvin.</li>
<li>So Willie and his comrade did not hear his advice.</li>
<li>They went in the lake where there had been some ice.</li>
<li>So Willie co-cramped, and there he fell in,</li>
<li>to the deep and cold waters on the lake top of Colvin.</li>
<li>And early next morning, Willie's father came there,</li>
<li>and he walked around the beach like a man in despair.</li>
<li>Think where was he drowned at, or how did he fall in,</li>
<li>to the deep and cold waters on the lake top of Colvin.</li>
<li>And the day of Willie's funeral, it was they sat in sight.</li>
<li>There were four and twenty young men, and they were all dressed in white.</li>
<li>And they took him to the churchyard, and they laid him in the clay.</li>
<li>Why, they're lovely Willie, and they all walked away.</li>
<li>You're o'er the land of Aaron's Isle, o'er the Atlantic Sea.</li>
<li>I would have you pay attention and listen a while to me.</li>
<li>As, as I, as I rode out for recreation down by the Euross Cay,</li>
<li>where there ran a pure-like stainless white bountiful American.</li>
<li>And I heard a lovely fair maid embracing a farmer's son.</li>
<li>Oh, Johnny, don't you leave me here, or fear I am undone.</li>
<li>For you were a young ant in your prime, and I told you better stay.</li>
<li>What dreams are those disturbed your mind of a wild American?</li>
<li>No, no, here I am, I'm all alone.</li>
<li>I didn't have the right crew for the first time.</li>
<li>Well, I'll tell you, I'm going to give you another one.</li>
<li>It was by the Radins.</li>
<li>I am a maid in love, and I dare not complain.</li>
<li>And for the sake of Jimmy, I cross a raging main.</li>
<li>And if I do not find him, I will mourn constantly.</li>
<li>And for the sake of Jimmy, a maid I'll live and die.</li>
<li>And a short jacket and long trousers this maiden she put on.</li>
<li>And like a gallant sailor bold, she gently walked along.</li>
<li>And she bargained with the captain her passage to get free.</li>
<li>For to be his own companion, I crossed the raging sea.</li>
<li>And one night as they were talking of going to their bed,</li>
<li>and the captain sighed and said, My love, I wish you were a maid.</li>
<li>Your dirty cheeks and ruby lips, they so entice me.</li>
<li>Oh, I wish to God in all my heart you were a maid for me.</li>
<li>Oh, hold your tongue, your captain, your talks are all the same.</li>
<li>And if the sailors would hear you, they would laugh and make their game.</li>
<li>And when we are on the other shore, some party you may find.</li>
<li>You may embrace them in your arms and say you will be kind.</li>
<li>Then in less than three weeks sailing, our vessel will reach the shore.</li>
<li>Oh, farewell, your captain, pay due for evermore.</li>
<li>Oh, once I was a sailor on board, but now I'm a maid on shore.</li>
<li>And farewell, your captain, pay due for evermore.</li>
<li>Come back, come back, my pretty maid, come back and stay with me.</li>
<li>I've got a handsome fortune on you, boy, it would be so.</li>
<li>Five hundred pounds a year, my love, is a fortune I'd give you.</li>
<li>If you'd consent and marry me and say you would be true.</li>
<li>Oh, hold your tongue, dear captain, your talk is all the same.</li>
<li>For once I have that sweetheart and for him I cross the main.</li>
<li>And if I do not find him, I will mourn constantly.</li>
<li>For the sake of giving that, I cross the main sea.</li>
<li>[The End]</li>
