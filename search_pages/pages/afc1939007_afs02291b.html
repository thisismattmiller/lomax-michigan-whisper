<li>Oh, the first time I've seen her, and I haven't seen her since she was jacking off a nigger through a bye-bye fence.</li>
<li>Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues. Oh, I got a gal in New York City, and she's got gumballs on her titty.</li>
<li>Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues. I got a gal in Battle Creek, and she's got a mortgage on my prick.</li>
<li>Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues. I got a gal in the Agri Falls, and she's got a mortgage on my balls.</li>
<li>Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues. Oh, and that old mortgage, it comes to lose my prick, and my ball, it's too. Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>I got a gal with pretty blue eyes, and she's got a crow's nest between her thighs. Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>I got a gal all dressed in red, and she makes her living on a feather bed. Oh, Lordy, Lord, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>Fifteen cents is a general price. You give her a quarter, and she'll do it twice. Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>I took her in the kitchen, and I threw her on the floor, and a wind from her hat blew the cat out the door. Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>Oh, the last time I seen her, and I haven't seen her since she was jackin' up, and I get through by bus, and so Lordy, Lordy, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>I went down to the river, and I tried to drown. She showed me her pussy, and I couldn't go down. Oh, Lord, Lord, I got those brown county blues.</li>
<li>Oh, the once pleasant Indian maid who ran a whorehouse trade. For to put the crack, she'd lay on her back and let the boys stick it in the crack.</li>
<li>One day, to her surprise, she saw her belly rise, and out jumped the nigger with the cast and jigger in the bowl between his eyes.</li>
