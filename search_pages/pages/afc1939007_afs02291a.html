<li>Oh, she stood out there in the midnight air, and the wind blew to her nightie, and the</li>
<li>moon shone down on the nipple of her tits, oh, Jeepers, Christ Almighty.</li>
<li>Then she jumped in her bed, and she covered up her head, and she swore that I could not</li>
<li>find her, but I knew damn well she lied like hell, so I jumped right in behind her.</li>
<li>I lifted up the sheet, and I took a little peep, and I saw her little behinders,</li>
<li>and as quick as a wink, I pushed my link right into her coffee grinder.</li>
<li>Come, all you young fellows, and listen to me, and I'll tell you a story that'll fill</li>
<li>you with glee, about a young maiden so fair and so small, she married a man who had no</li>
<li>balls at all, oh, the very first night that they climbed into bed, her cheeks, they were</li>
<li>rosy, her lips, they were red, she reached for his peter, his peter was small, she bowed</li>
<li>for his balls, he had no balls at all, no balls at all, no balls at all, she married</li>
<li>a man who had no balls at all, oh, mother, dear mother, I wish I were dead, laid in the</li>
<li>cold ground with my poor maiden head, there's many a man that has answered the call to the</li>
<li>wife of, the wife of the man who has no balls at all, oh, daughter, dear daughter, don't</li>
<li>take it so bad, the very same trouble I had with your dad, there's many a man that has</li>
<li>answered the call to the wife of a man who has no balls at all, oh, she called in the</li>
<li>ice man so brave and so true, come next Tuesday morning, I'll pack each for you, a bounding</li>
<li>young baby was born the next fall, to the wife of the man who had no balls at all, no</li>
<li>balls at all, no balls at all, she married a man who had no balls at all, oh, tree, oh,</li>
<li>horse from Canada, oh, drunken cherry wine, the main conversation was your cunt no bigger</li>
<li>than mine, so feel on my naked belly and smell on my slimy slew, go rattle your nuts across</li>
<li>my guts, you're one of the horny crew, the first jumped up was the plumber's wife and</li>
<li>she was dressed in green, and in one corner of her wrap-a-tuff-tuff she had a limousine,</li>
<li>oh, a limousine, a limousine, a paper and a press, and in the other corner of her snack</li>
<li>she had one hell of a mess, so feel on my naked belly and smell on my slimy slew, go</li>
<li>rattle your nuts across my guts, you're one of the horny crew.</li>
