<li>Father, dear, I often heard you speak of Aaron's Isle. It seems so bright and beautiful, and I am so glad to hear you speak of it. - John Lennon.</li>
<li>Father, dear, I often heard you speak of Aaron's Isle. It seems so bright and beautiful, how rich and rare the isle.</li>
<li>Say, it is a lovely land. We're in a Prince Michael. And why did you abandon it? The reason, you'll be told.</li>
<li>Then he answered, Dear son, I love my native home, with fervor and with pride. It's peaceful groves and mountains and valleys broad and wide.</li>
<li>And there I roamed through manhood and sported when they bide. The shamrock and chilele was my constant sport and guide.</li>
<li>But when all the bleak came o'er the place, the sheep and cattle died. The rack rent, too, alas, was due. We could not have supplies.</li>
<li>The landlard brothers from the cock were born, you have a bane. Now that's my by the reason that I left the skipperene.</li>
<li>And your mother, too, God rest her, she lay on the troubled ground. She fainted in her anguish at the desolation ground.</li>
<li>She never was but passed away, two lives from us to see. Now that's my by the reason why I left the skipperene.</li>
<li>And well do I remember that sad day of '98. We rose in vengeance with the boys to battle against fate.</li>
<li>They drove us to the mountains like traitors to the queen. Now that's my by the reason why I left the skipperene.</li>
<li>And you were scarcely six months old, and feeble was your frame. I could not leave you with your friends, you bore my father's bane.</li>
<li>I wrapped you in my cop-a-more, and dead of night unseen, I heaved a sigh and bid good-bye to poor old the skipperene.</li>
<li>Oh, Father, when will the day come, when for vengeance we will call, when Irish men through field and thin will rally one and all?</li>
<li>I'll be the mantle, leave the land, beneath the flag of the green, and loud and high I'll raise a cry, Revenge for Skipperene.</li>
<li>Oh, that's an old Irish recipe.</li>
<li>Indeed, yes. God, my father-in-law could sing that.</li>
<li>It makes your hair stand up. It used to stand on the floor, and a lot of them Irish guys from Ireland around them.</li>
<li>Do you think Ireland ever will get to be on her own?</li>
<li>Oh, she's pretty near there now.</li>
<li>Do you think Ireland will go back there and not have to?</li>
<li>I'd like to go back.</li>
<li>Will it? Will it?</li>
<li>Oh, that's the greatest country in the world.</li>
<li>Good God, they'd be able to put a sign there.</li>
<li>Well, I've got quite a lot of relations over there, but that wouldn't mean anything.</li>
<li>Oh, that's, that's, that's God's only country.</li>
<li>Yeah, I get that.</li>
