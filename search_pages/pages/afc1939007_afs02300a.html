<li>2300A</li>
<li>The sign of the cross on my forehead</li>
<li>As I kneel on this cold dungeon floor</li>
<li>As I kneel at your feet, reverend father, with no one but God to the fore</li>
<li>I have told you the faults of my boyhood, the follies and sins of my youth</li>
<li>And it's now from this crime of my manhood I speak with the same open truth</li>
<li>You see, sir, the land was our people's for ninety long years in their toil</li>
<li>What was first a bare bit of mountain brought into good wheat-bearing soil</li>
<li>Was our hands rose the walls of our cabins</li>
<li>Where our children were born and bred</li>
<li>Where our weddings and christens was merry, where we wept and keened over our dead</li>
<li>We were honest and fair to the landlord, we paid him the rent of the day</li>
<li>And it wasn't our fault if our hearts sweat, they squandered and wasted away</li>
<li>In the cars and the dice and the race course and often the deeper disgrace</li>
<li>That no tongue could relate without bringing a blush to an honest man's face</li>
<li>But the day came at last that they worked hard when the castles, the mansions and land</li>
<li>They should hold but untrust for the people till their shame passed away from their hands</li>
<li>And our placer, too, went to auction by many the acre was soft</li>
<li>And what care the stranger that purchased who made him a good starly bond</li>
<li>The old folks were gone, thank God for it, where troubles or cares can pursue</li>
<li>But the wife and the children, oh father in heaven, what was I to do</li>
<li>Sure I thought I'll go speak to that new man and kill him of me and of mine</li>
<li>And the trifle that I put together I'll place in his hands as a fine</li>
<li>The estate is worth six times the money and maybe his heart isn't cold</li>
<li>But the scoundrel that bought the thief's penny worth was worse than the pauper that sold</li>
<li>Well, I chased him to house and to office wherever I thought he'll be then</li>
<li>And I offered him all he'd put on it but note was the land he should get</li>
<li>I prayed as man only to God prayed, my prayers they were spurned and denied</li>
<li>And no matter how just my right was when he had the law at his side</li>
<li>I was young and few years married to one with a voice like a bird</li>
<li>When she sang the songs of our country every feeling within me was stirred</li>
<li>Why sear this minute before me with a foot wouldn't bend a croneen</li>
<li>And her laughing eyes lifted to kiss me, my charming, my bright eye to lean</li>
