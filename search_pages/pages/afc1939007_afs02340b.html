<li>AFS recording number 2340, side B.</li>
<li>To Jackson lay down the barroom floor, he had drank so much, couldn't drink no more. He went to sleep with a troubled brain, to have a dream he was riding on the hell-bound train.</li>
<li>And the engine was covered with a red dandan, proudly lit with a brimstone lamp, and boiler it was full, a lager beer, and devil themselves were staying seen here.</li>
<li>And Jackson stood by the fire hole, and he could make the fire go, and the fuel that was used was the human bones, an engine rung with a thousand stones.</li>
<li>And rough, and rough, and a gondry groove, and faster, and faster, the engine blew, and fast, and fast, and go.</li>
<li>And rough, and rough, and a gondry groove, and faster, and faster, the engine blew.</li>
<li>And the passengers, the natures, the awful crew, they were the rich men, poor men, and the island yoke, rich in a broad blood, and beggar in the rags, the hands of young maidens, and bitter as all hags.</li>
<li>And they prayed for the paid, for the paid in vain, for the devil to stop this hell-bound train.</li>
<li>And they heard an awful yell, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, face the devil, we are near in the hell. And the fire will burn, and the face will be raw, and the devil will be laughing at you more and more.</li>
<li>Then Andrew Jackson, wake up with awful grime, his hands, his hair stand up, and all sweat and hands stand in strife.</li>
