<li>A.F.S. Recording Number 2331 Side A.</li>
<li>While the battle fought was raging, and they shot themselves, it's like smoke around the cover, rigging, curling, when I heard a piercing cry.</li>
<li>Close beside me lie our fibers on his bosom's purged blood, where he lies pierced by a bullet, dying in a crimping flood.</li>
<li>Shipmates that he'd tell my father, tell him I died like a man.</li>
<li>Oh, I died in battle for my country, while Bloody Ronnie, a Terran friend. Tell my mother, gently tell her, please, the news would break her heart.</li>
<li>That her son once more will greet her, nevermore the ocean crawls.</li>
<li>Oh, how sad I am to leave her, how she'll mourn about my loss, for her Charlie nevermore will greet her, nevermore the ocean crawls.</li>
<li>Tell my sister, heaven bless her, on Potomac's sunny shore.</li>
<li>That her brother, tell my sister, heaven bless her, on Potomac's sunny shore.</li>
<li>Hand in hand, no more will gum, hand in hand, no more will ramble, on Potomac's sunny shore.</li>
<li>Tell my brother, no, I get it. No wait, I get it. I get it, I get it, I get it.</li>
<li>My sister, heaven bless her, that she'll never see me more, hand in hand, no more will ramble, on old Hudson's pleasant shore.</li>
<li>Tell my brother in the army, on Potomac's sunny shore, that our Navy is victorious, and always be so, evermore.</li>
<li>That our Navy is victorious, and always be so, evermore. There he'll I hear from talking, gently he'll slip, slip, slip, slip.</li>
