<li>2293, B, 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>And they sailed down fast past the Hibble land, where handsome Janie produced him. He took me by the hand. He says, I'm gold and friendly, and love with me you'll find.</li>
<li>So I've been part of that, my parents, and that's the girl I've left behind.</li>
<li>Now my father, and his wife, and my mother, and they understand my own true love, wiping off her tears. They have all died brokenhearted, and I am sorrow-fined, and may God give my cruelty to that girl.</li>
<li>That's the girl I've left behind.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Do you remember the first time I saw you?</li>
<li>Very first time.</li>
<li>The only time we were together was two times two.</li>
<li>Two times.</li>
<li>You want to know what happened? I don't think so. I don't think that girl was the one.</li>
<li>At the end of classes one fine summer's day, they all hunted cattle to the woods and they'd get strayed.</li>
<li>They came to a shanty at the foot of a hill, where noonshine and dew, they got their fill.</li>
<li>There was winters in Tampa going to town, hating the boys all the way up and down.</li>
<li>They'd talk in two cars just to get a first cup, where they met with Jack Tully, a-licking them up. They got in their cars and started to work out and fuckers.</li>
<li>Jack Tully came following them.</li>
<li>Oh, come on.</li>
<li>When the news went around that the youth were in jail and could not get home to the sale that night,</li>
<li>then from night to night, they took a full action and put the fuck on the jail.</li>
<li>The day they were taken was a big day in town. The bootleggers they came gathering around.</li>
<li>There was Eddie and Jimmy and Karn so tall and a number of others and Watkins and all.</li>
<li>At the bootleggers' room there was a mixed crowd and some were all laughing and smiling through the day.</li>
<li>Even the ladies with smiles on their lips said, Now, my brave fellows, give the bootleggers a kiss.</li>
<li>As for the bootleggers, they all had their say, said, Now, my brave boys, don't give us away.</li>
<li>They were taken to California and ran into the jail. Without even crying questions, they did not avail.</li>
<li>They stuck to their story. The first they did say, Shallowdown came out.</li>
<li>He's Jack Winters by name Healy. The whole story it was his own song.</li>
<li>The ending right there, Healy, the whole story it was his own thing.</li>
<li>See, they were taken across.</li>
<li>What was this song about?</li>
<li>About three years ago.</li>
<li>About three years ago, you know.</li>
<li>About two fellows, see, they weren't of age.</li>
<li>That's when the bootleggers, they went out on the cattle and they met up with them.</li>
<li>They got drunk, see.</li>
<li>No, no. They went down in time.</li>
<li>They went from the way up to West Side, from the way up to West Side, from the way up to West Side, and they stopped into another place, a place for the men of Compton. Here was the sheriff. Jack Telley was the sheriff at the time.</li>
<li>And he followed them to town. When he got downtown though, he ran them in jail, see.</li>
<li>And then he died up for carnage again.</li>
<li>That meant, like, here in his court, but for carnage again.</li>
<li>I don't know who was it. I don't know who found him.</li>
<li>Somebody butted the lock on her.</li>
<li>I know who that was. Who was it?</li>
<li>Jordan Franklin left.</li>
<li>Yeah?</li>
<li>Yeah. James Henry was playing a long time after.</li>
<li>That was the two fellows that did that.</li>
<li>Would you like to try to sing it again now?</li>
<li>You want to sing that again?</li>
<li>Maybe you want me to grab it.</li>
<li>Hey, there's another, did you read that other part down there? That other piece, do you want that?</li>
<li>Save the Last Dance for me, sweetheart.</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>You don't want that, huh?</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>You want to try it out again, really?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Come on, do it. Do what we'll do it.</li>
<li>Are you ready?</li>
<li>The European transfers once by summer's day When I was hunting cattle to the woods they did stray</li>
<li>They came to a candy at the foot of a hill Where moon-tiamber they got their fill</li>
<li>With landers and tappers all into town Takin' the boys all the way up and down</li>
<li>They stopped in two carriages to get a fresh cup Workin' at the jack-o'-lantern like a momma</li>
<li>Riding in their cars and start a war town And the jack-o'-lantern, jack-o'-lanterns all the way down</li>
<li>He and his friends then gave them them in And he poured the beer for kind of sagging</li>
<li>When the news went around that they were in jail And could not get home to the trail</li>
<li>And then two friends followed for friendship They took a full act and broken the locks on the jail</li>
<li>The day they were taken was a big day in town The bootleggers, they all gathered around</li>
<li>There was Reddy and Jimmy and Pine both all And a number of others and one and then all At the bootleggers, you know they're all in</li>
<li>There were Reddy and Jimmy and Pine both all And a number of others and one and then all At the bootleggers, you know they're all in</li>
<li>There was Reddy and Jimmy and Pine both all And a number of others and one and then all At the bootleggers, you know they're all in</li>
