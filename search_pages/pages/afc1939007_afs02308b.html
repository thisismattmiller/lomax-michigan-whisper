<li>2308B.</li>
<li>It's off the fair young soldier, when marching down to the war, to fight for Father Abraham and for his northern cause.</li>
<li>He loved the fair young damsel, as you shall shortly hear, or she was the apple-core beside this galling soldier.</li>
<li>Rump the dump the dump the dump the dump the diddley-oh-day.</li>
<li>Oh, the name of this young soldier was Charles of Dalphastorn.</li>
<li>The name of this young damsel was Jerusha Pillygonhorn.</li>
<li>Oh, she was a court-winner, a slupe, a lad both gay and keen.</li>
<li>Oh, she was a fireman's engineer, she ran the sewing machine.</li>
<li>Rump the dump the dump the dump the dump the diddley-oh-day.</li>
<li>Oh, Charles of Dalphastorn, as you're going away, except to this fair hand of mine, a beautiful bouquet.</li>
<li>Here's a little sprig of warm wood and a little tanz of too.</li>
<li>It's when you take your bitterest thing of Jerusha, do, do, do.</li>
<li>Rump the dump the dump the dump the dump the diddley-oh-day.</li>
<li>Then straightway to Port Royal, this gallant youth did steer.</li>
<li>Oh, there he took to playing cards and drinking lager beers.</li>
<li>He got very much demoralized, as we do understand.</li>
<li>Forgot his own Jerusha dear, and he married the country man.</li>
<li>Rump the dump the dump the dump the dump the diddley-oh-day.</li>
<li>Oh, when Jerusha heard on it, she was very much angry.</li>
<li>Seeing that he has gone away, I'll show you what I will be.</li>
<li>Stab myself with a cobbler's awl, commit to Susan's side.</li>
<li>Now that last verse there.</li>
<li>Oh, when Jerusha heard on it, she was very much angry yet.</li>
<li>She says, I wish I had him here, I'd punch his treacherous head.</li>
<li>She got very much angry, gave up the ghost, she died.</li>
<li>Oh, I need to follow this now, follow this now, follow this now.</li>
<li>When Jerusha heard on it, she was very much angry yet.</li>
<li>She says, I wish I had him here, I'd punch his treacherous head.</li>
<li>When Jerusha heard on it, she was very much angry yet.</li>
<li>She says, I wish I had him here, I'd punch his treacherous head.</li>
<li>Still, the more she thought of it, the more she began to grieve.</li>
<li>She says, For Charles the Dolphin's sake, the prettier world I leave.</li>
<li>She sat down up on the ground and committed to Susan's side.</li>
<li>She stabbed herself with a cobbler's awl, committed to Susan's side.</li>
<li>Come all you young fellows who go to southern land that don't play cards</li>
<li>and drink bad beer and marry a country band.</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
<li>[SIDE CONVERSATION]</li>
