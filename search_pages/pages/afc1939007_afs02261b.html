<li>2,261, B1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>Oh noble Lord of the high duty, carry us back to the start.</li>
<li>Oh noble Lord of the high duty, come passing by on a milk-wise tea.</li>
<li>Oh noble Lord of the high duty, carry us back to the start.</li>
<li>He pulled out his purse of gold, as much as his both hands could hold.</li>
<li>Oh, this I'll give for your maiden head, and her two cheeks blushed like the rosy red.</li>
<li>Oh noble Lord of the high duty, how can you pass such marks on me?</li>
<li>For tomorrow morning I'm to be wed, and my love shall enjoy my maiden head.</li>
<li>Then he, but give me the money all in my hand, and I will neither set nor stand.</li>
<li>For the money is as good to me as any maiden head could be.</li>
<li>Then while that he was looking a place, she mounted on his milk-wise tea.</li>
<li>He called, he called, but he called in vain, for she never looked it back again.</li>
<li>She never thought herself quite safe, but she wrote till she came to her true love's gate.</li>
<li>She loved him of his speed and gold, and left him the empty pails for the home.</li>
<li>It pleased her true love to the heart, to see how well she could play her part.</li>
<li>Sing tomorrow morning we're to be wed, and I'll take a slap at your maiden head.</li>
<li>Oh my love come to my bedside and says what shall I do?</li>
<li>Jump into bed you silly fair maiden, get out of the foggy dew.</li>
<li>Oh it's on the first part of that night, my love felt happy and glee.</li>
<li>And on the second part of that night, she rolled and tumbled with me.</li>
<li>But on the third part of that night, her dress, but by Jesus I saw it.</li>
<li>As I walked out to Nottoway City, just at ten the other night, there I spied this dark-eyed gypsy,</li>
<li>watching her snatch at the moon-shown pipe.</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>Madam if you'd lose your garter, tie it a little above your knee.</li>
<li>If I could I would go higher, very angry you would be.</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>Blue it is a handsome color, when it gets a second dip.</li>
<li>Like young men when they go courting, they most certainly get their slip.</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>Madam when you're in your bedchamber, where young maidens often be.</li>
<li>If I could I'd go and see you, very angry you would be.</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>Madam if I'd swell your belly, swell it big as big could be.</li>
<li>If I could I'd swell it bigger, would you fathom it on me?</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>All that night we talked in company, till it was a break of day.</li>
<li>Mother heaven protect me from all danger, open your eyes and I'll fly away.</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>My father he was a lumbering merchant, he a listed long ago.</li>
<li>And this request was all he asked of me, was to answer all men, no.</li>
<li>And she says, no, no sir, no, and all her land serves its purpose, no.</li>
<li>She was something like that song.</li>
<li>I think that damn thing, I got looking at that, you know what I'm trying to say.</li>
<li>You know what I'm trying to say.</li>
<li>There's some damn thing about that, I never felt as damn cheap when I was singing my life.</li>
<li>Where'd you learn that song Bill?</li>
<li>No, I can't tell you that, no I can't tell them.</li>
<li>So many of them, I used to know Satan, you'll know me a long time.</li>
<li>You hear everybody around here say, what do they say about it?</li>
<li>They say, well I know more songs than you can consider.</li>
<li>There are more songs and you can sing them better.</li>
<li>And the general run of men has long been yet, but has long been yet.</li>
