<li>Mr. Charlie, Mr. Charlie, What's the matter with you?</li>
<li>Although I have done everything, what do you ask me to do?</li>
<li>Now look here, Slim, they tell me you was known to be the baddest shine that is on the line.</li>
<li>Is it true about you carrying 245 around?</li>
<li>And is it a fact that every time you kill a man, that you put the notch on your gun?</li>
<li>Let me look at your gun, Slim.</li>
<li>Mmm. Mmm hmm. Pretty tough guy.</li>
<li>There's one place there I don't see, what is that? That's kind of a splash. What kind of man is that?</li>
<li>Mmm hmm. Now, Slim, I'll tell you, since you're in the camp, I'm going to try to buy everything to suit you, to try to please you.</li>
<li>I don't want no trouble out of you, and I guess you is the same by me.</li>
<li>Now, do you know this is Mr. Law Sloterman talking to you now, Slim?</li>
<li>Yeah, I don't care nothing about Mr. Law, no more than I do no one else.</li>
<li>Well, Slim, tell me what do you call this flour bread that I got here? I bought the best flour that could be bought.</li>
<li>And you tell me, to my face, that when this biscuit is made from the best cook, that there are cat heads.</li>
<li>I can't get that. Yeah, there are cat heads, strictly cat heads. What are you going to do about it?</li>
<li>Now, that's things, Slim.</li>
<li>Slim, I went to Memphis and bought the best eye-bucker company that the eye-bucker company could afford to me.</li>
<li>And they tell me that you call it Jabba. Is that true, Slim?</li>
<li>Yes, Jabba. What can you make out of it?</li>
<li>Nothing, Slim. That's OK.</li>
<li>Now, Slim, they tell me that you call every meal I got on my jaw a shaving tail.</li>
<li>What do you mean by shaving tail, Slim?</li>
<li>They are no good. They are plug.</li>
<li>All right, Slim. Now, Slim, there is one thing I would like for you to do.</li>
<li>In that area this morning, I want you to go down to the river with me.</li>
<li>I want to see what kind of a marksman you are.</li>
<li>And if you're a pretty good marksman, I want to take you on my hunt.</li>
<li>I'm going out for a hunt, and I want real good marksmen.</li>
<li>All right, we pitched the ball out in the creek.</li>
<li>And I take my shot. Look up there, Slim, I missed six clear shots.</li>
<li>Now, let's see if you can hit the ball while she's floating.</li>
<li>One, two, three, four. Oh, yeah, you hit it.</li>
<li>All right, Slim, I want to pitch one more and see if you can hit it.</li>
<li>There we go. All right, Slim, one, two. You missed it.</li>
<li>Now, Slim, do you have an air gun or anything?</li>
<li>Oh, no, there's no need to load that revolver. You have another one.</li>
<li>Let's see what you have in that revolver.</li>
<li>All right, let's go. One, two, three, four, five, six.</li>
<li>Oh, Slim, you hit it in the sixth time.</li>
<li>Now, Slim, let's see if you got another revolver. No, that's all.</li>
<li>No other revolver. I can reload. No, no need to reload.</li>
<li>You quite showed that that's your last cottage, and that's the only revolver you have.</li>
<li>Yeah, that's all I have. Well, look here, Slim, here's what I want to tell you.</li>
<li>Do you know this is Mr. Law, Mr. Law Sloran?</li>
<li>Slim, I didn't like your look when your face walked in the camp.</li>
<li>And I told Bruce Wilkins Shorty to tell you that I wanted to see you this morning.</li>
<li>And this is what I want to tell you, Slim, out of all of the flowers that I could buy,</li>
<li>call it java, cat heads, call it java.</li>
<li>You call the best meal, costing me $250 each, you call them shaving tails.</li>
<li>Slim, I don't like this.</li>
<li>Now, listen, Slim, you get on the government ridge and top long greens.</li>
<li>Stand on the government ridge and let your feet run away with your body.</li>
<li>Let's get moving on time.</li>
<li>Partner, partner, now don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Well, I ain't no stranger.</li>
<li>Partner, partner, I've been down in the camp before.</li>
<li>My God, down in the camp before.</li>
<li>[Silence]</li>
