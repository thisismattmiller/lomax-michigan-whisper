<li>AFS recording number 2347, side A.</li>
<li>Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam, that deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Where seldom is heard a deer scurrying, where the skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Seldom is heard this harrowing word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam, that deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Where seldom is heard a discouraging word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Seldom is heard a discouraging word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>The red man has pressed from the part of the west, he's likely no more to return.</li>
<li>To the banks of Red River where seldom ever the flickering campfires burn.</li>
<li>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Seldom is heard a discouraging word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>I love the white flower in the dear land of ours, girl I love tutoring.</li>
<li>I love the white rock and the antelope flock, that breeze on the mountain so green.</li>
<li>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Seldom is heard a discouraging word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>Oh, awesome at night when the heavens are bright, with the light of the flickering stars.</li>
<li>Oh, I stood there amazed, I ask as I gaze, is the glory sufficient of ours?</li>
<li>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Seldom is heard a discouraging word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
<li>I love the white flowers in the dear land of ours.</li>
<li>Oh, give me the land where the white diamond sand flows leisurely down to the stream,</li>
<li>where the grateful white swan goes gliding along like a maiden in heavenly dreams.</li>
<li>Home, home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play.</li>
<li>Seldom is heard a discouraging word, skies are not cloudy all day.</li>
