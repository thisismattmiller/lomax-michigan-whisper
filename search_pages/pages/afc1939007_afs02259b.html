<li>2259, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>I was out there with a team, I saw a tree and the tree came back and knocked him down and fell on me, big heavy tree.</li>
<li>Oh yeah, killed him, yeah. Well of course as long as he was there, not instantly, he couldn't take his breath out of his bum.</li>
<li>He went back there for a few minutes, but he died in 20 minutes, 10 minutes, maybe his breath there a little.</li>
<li>But quickly we could get the saw on that, saw that, saw that off just as fast as we could and all that logged off on him while we got him out of there.</li>
<li>Yes. If he would speak at all, sometimes they'd make you to hurry up or kill him, hit him, you know he was dying right there.</li>
<li>Well sure. I've seen fellows get instantly killed. I've seen a fellow one time, he jumped upon a roll, he's been out, he's been off of the jandos man, crack a jack, he got up and he made a nose.</li>
<li>He went out, he got drinking a little bit, he came back with a quart of whiskey.</li>
<li>There's a load there, a load of whiskey on the slave, and he got, he fetched him this here, a quart of whiskey and he said here boy, have a drink.</li>
<li>He was pretty full, staggering around, pretty full drinking.</li>
<li>Well he knew he was an awful good jandos man who was counting one of his goods he was in northern Michigan.</li>
<li>So he said give me this hook, he said take a drink, give me this hook, he said I'll put on that top log.</li>
<li>He said no, no, no, no, don't do that, no, you're too full.</li>
<li>No, because hell, he said, give me that hook, I'll load this log.</li>
<li>He said no, this copper, he said no, he says Jim, he says you're too drunk to do this.</li>
<li>Hell, he says God Almighty never made a log to catch me.</li>
<li>Well now that's an awful lot for a man to make.</li>
<li>Down to go up there, scrap, right there, you see, drinking little, and he's best friends, go good friends.</li>
<li>Grab that hook, gets up there, up comes the log and he puts up the knife on him.</li>
<li>Well he kept the log all right, you know, it's been all right, but this little brat gave away, stuck on the hand of his hook.</li>
<li>The brat peeled off and he missed the log and he killed him, smashed his head right out, killed him right there.</li>
<li>Come over and knock him down, you know, and smack his head, smack him right again, another log, and that's that log, smack the head.</li>
<li>Top of his head right off, kill him.</li>
<li>Why do you suppose that happened?</li>
<li>Huh?</li>
<li>Why do you think, why do you suppose that happened?</li>
<li>Just because he was drunk?</li>
<li>Well sure, well he just, accidentally, maybe sometime, if he's been perfectly sober.</li>
<li>You might catch a log that way, it didn't win quite far enough, your hook.</li>
<li>Let me give it, find enough yards to get in there, quick, quick.</li>
<li>And the brat peeled off, well the brat stuck on the end of that hook, why he couldn't get into the log unless he'd give it a crack like that, quick, you know, bust the brat.</li>
<li>Goes in to the meat, that log, we could hold.</li>
<li>I used to deck with a log, with a fellow that, he's the one that stands in the log, he'd almost stand in the middle, he'd say, he's a big fellow, or a calm wildcatcher.</li>
<li>He'd catch her if due, but if his hook would happen to make one mess, where would he be hardy?</li>
<li>Maybe he couldn't jump, but if he was to end the log, maybe he could clear himself and get over it, you see, or something.</li>
<li>I'd never stand in the middle hardy ever, once in a while on a kind of small log, I knew I could hold if I catch it anyway,</li>
<li>so I'd sometimes just pick him up pretty fast with a keen factor reader than you'd think for, you know.</li>
<li>It's dangerous work anyway, a man's got to be on his guard to do that kind of work.</li>
<li>It's no fun of a job, a greenhorn don't want to get up there and do it unless he works in the woods a while, because if he does, he's lost out.</li>
<li>How do you want to do that? Looks like you've got to kill what I am.</li>
<li>Well, practicing no turning the drain, for instance, you've got to have a can up with you, all right, you're loading on that drain.</li>
<li>You come up and the swamper will help, the swamper will cut the road, and the drain will tend to be around, help to pull around the drain,</li>
<li>and if we can't get started loading a big log with the horses, he'll roll down with the hook, you see, with the can hook.</li>
<li>If it's too often a bigger log that he can't roll, we've got to clip the seam from the drain, from the nose of the drain over here,</li>
<li>and throw a chain over, and it hits down the bunk, and hits down to the log, and then throw the chain over this way,</li>
<li>and pull your seam off that way, and up will come the log around the drain.</li>
<li>Then you put the chain around it, take it to the skidway.</li>
<li>Now, lots of fellas put in the hook, they practice that, practice that, how to handle the can hook.</li>
<li>Now, I ain't took over the can hook in quite a while, but I bet I can take over the can hook and do quite a good job at it right now.</li>
<li>Not as good as some of them could, because they're practicing. I seen one over at Eatonville, seen awful good loaders there.</li>
<li>One fella, he got so wet in the air about that, as high as that, and he kept his logs, and they could go up straight.</li>
<li>He was a good loader. His brother was up on top loading.</li>
<li>Well, now his brother stood there, he was up there loading, and this log came out.</li>
<li>But just before he'd done that, I said to my wife, I said, Dear, load on the contest there, see which one beats.</li>
<li>Two crews, one over there and one here. They're doing this, see how fast and how good they can put these loads on.</li>
<li>And when they done it, got a, when they got their money, you know, they did quite a bit of money over there for that work.</li>
<li>The one that loaded, the crew that loaded their load quickest got money.</li>
<li>The others got some, but not as much as these first ones, like a prize fight or anything of that kind.</li>
<li>Well, now we stood there, and I told a hundred people that stood around there since the '60s.</li>
<li>This crew was awful good, but when they picked the logs there, had the slays put there, they put a hundred and some logs on one slay.</li>
<li>One slay broke right down, broke and bunked right down. The last log came over there.</li>
<li>Oh, the slays have been made quite a good amount of years, but they're old, they're beginning to get old now.</li>
<li>But they're painted and kept, I know. Blame me, he said, I wish I'd listened to you, he said.</li>
<li>Yes, he was another nice fellow. Yeah, yeah.</li>
<li>Did you ever know anybody that was at all like Paul Bunyan?</li>
<li>What?</li>
<li>Did you ever know anybody like Paul Bunyan?</li>
<li>Oh, no, not just like him. That's just a story made up, you know, about Paul Bunyan.</li>
<li>That's just a story. Everything is made up like that.</li>
<li>You know the fellow that they used to call a brother by the name of old Jim Baghe?</li>
<li>He used to lumber himself, he was a lumberman, a little bit. That is, a jobber, he'd take jobs.</li>
<li>He was a great fellow to spur out and do his work, something like Paul Bunyan, taking on this and that.</li>
<li>And tell you about this thing and that thing and how to do all these things and everything.</li>
<li>He said he was the first man that loved the Hootie Tootie River on two bales of cotton.</li>
<li>That was the goddamn thing. He could give us all this, you know, shit and all sorts of things like that.</li>
<li>Oh, I don't know, tell you about what he had done and worked on around the river and all these things like that.</li>
<li>Tell you big shots of things and what he could do and how he carried 500 pounds a shot right over the new pavement.</li>
<li>They put it in there, took 500 pounds in each hand of buckshot, took it in the sack,</li>
<li>and he walked across that new pavement and he sunk through into his knees.</li>
<li>All sorts of things like that, you know, leading on to that.</li>
<li>Well, that's the story about what they get up about Paul Bunyan or Jim Baghe.</li>
<li>The funny thing, I never heard him tell any Paul Bunyan stories about women.</li>
<li>You know, what Paul Bunyan could do with a woman.</li>
<li>No, I never did. I don't do anything about that. I never heard him say anything like that.</li>
<li>Did you ever hear anything like that? I never did that, no.</li>
<li>He went to work in this prairie island, he said he would get right up and tell you, you would think it's just so.</li>
<li>I used to work for Paul quite a good bet, he used to get up and say.</li>
<li>See, I used to work for Paul.</li>
<li>And one time he says Paul got a big track of timber and he went up and looked this year's track over and built the camp.</li>
<li>But he went around and seen a big stream of water there and didn't go around.</li>
<li>Well, he bought this year's timber and the reason why this year's timber stayed in there</li>
<li>is because it was such a long way some days to get dealt to a stream.</li>
<li>Well, Paul, he didn't look around to see where he was buying and he bought this timber quite cheap at that time.</li>
<li>He said that they went up there and made a mess of camps and everything</li>
<li>and they worked there all winter and put in the hardest coolers, started to dry.</li>
<li>Well, finally when they started, well, finally when they started.</li>
