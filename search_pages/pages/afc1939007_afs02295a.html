<li>2295, A1 and 2.</li>
<li>By the border of the ocean,</li>
<li>on a morning in the marimba above me,</li>
<li>to hear the warbler's song stir, her dipole notes a charming tune.</li>
<li>And I overheard a fair maid talking, and she seemed to be in grief and woe.</li>
<li>She was conversing with young Bonie Part, concerning the Bonie bunch of roses, oh.</li>
<li>And up stepped young Napoleon, and he took his mother by the hand.</li>
<li>Oh mother dear have patience until I am able to command, and then I will purchase an army,</li>
<li>and through tremendous dangers I will go, and I will conquer Moscow, and return with the Bonie bunch of roses, oh.</li>
<li>Oh son don't be so venturesome, for England is the heart of oak.</li>
<li>There was England, Ireland, and Scotland, whose unity was never broke.</li>
<li>You may look upon your father on the isle of St. Helena, his body lies low.</li>
<li>And you will follow after, now beware of that Bonie bunch of roses, oh.</li>
<li>He had an army of five hundred thousand men, and he had kings as well to bear his throne.</li>
<li>And he was so well prepared that he thought he could take the world alone.</li>
<li>But when he came to Moscow, he was overpowered by the age within snow.</li>
<li>And Moscow was a-blazing, and there he lost the Bonie bunch of roses, oh.</li>
<li>That England, Ireland, and Scotland.</li>
<li>Well he had been master of the whole world at that time, but that was the blunder that he made.</li>
<li>He went to Moscow in the middle of winter.</li>
<li>And when the people of Moscow saw him come to burnt the city, they burnt, he said, I never thought that a man would burn his own home.</li>
<li>They burnt the whole city, and his army starved.</li>
<li>They, they, they screwed him.</li>
<li>That was Napoleon's son.</li>
<li>Yeah, that was Napoleon's son.</li>
<li>This is his son talking to the mother.</li>
<li>This is the son, this is the son talking to his mother.</li>
<li>Telling her what happened to his father.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Oh, she's telling him what happened.</li>
<li>She said he had an army of five hundred thousand men, and kings as well to bear his throne.</li>
<li>And he was so well prepared he thought, he thought he could take the world alone.</li>
<li>Of course he never had, did he ever conquer England and Scotland?</li>
<li>I'm telling you he had the world conquered only Russia.</li>
<li>He had the old world, Europe conquered.</li>
<li>Did you ever read the history of that?</li>
<li>Well, England and Ireland and Scotland was the morning bunch of roses.</li>
<li>That's what they called them.</li>
<li>He had the entire world conquered only Russia.</li>
<li>And he went to Moscow and that's what, and then he came back and fought the battle of Waterloo where he got beat.</li>
<li>An Irishman, the Duke of Wellington, beat him, an Irishman.</li>
<li>On pleasant evenings as pinks and daisies held in their bosom a drop of dew, they feathered warblers of every species,</li>
<li>together chanted, They're an also true.</li>
<li>Alone I prayed, rapped, and meditated, and it calmed my heart for to hear them sing. They silenced arms up when I were just arising.</li>
<li>They aired in concert, did as weekly as things, which I transported each side I corded while still gazing around with an inspective eye.</li>
<li>Two youthful lovers in conversation, closed by a gate there, I exasperated.</li>
<li>This couple spoke with such force of reason, and their sentiments they expressed so clear.</li>
<li>And just to listen to their conversation, my inclination was to draw near.</li>
<li>He pressed her hand and he said, My darling, tell me the reason you have changed your mind or have I loved you,</li>
<li>to be degraded though youth and innocence are in its prime.</li>
<li>For I am slighted and requited for all the favors that I did be so. You'll surely tell me before you leave me why you're inclined for to treat me so.</li>
<li>With great acuteness she did make answer, Sir, on your favors I would rely, but I'm afraid you might blast my glory on our wedding day.</li>
<li>You might overmind. Young men in general are fickle-minded and far too trustful, I am afraid, as to your favors.</li>
<li>If I am indebted, both stock and interest you shall be paid.</li>
<li>I never intended or fickle-minded will I ever be as far as my debt. You can never pay them except by true love and loyalty.</li>
<li>Remember, darling, our first engagement when childish pleasures were all but you, be true and vile. I'm thine forever, I will brave all dangers and abode you.</li>
<li>All you speak exceedingly, but not corrective, with words supporting your causes vain, had you the tongue of a siren goddess, your exhortation I would disdain.</li>
<li>It was your love that I did require, but since you placed it on golden store, I'll strike my strings, and my heart will marmorate you, my darling, forevermore.</li>
<li>But had you, darling, when you were born, what nature gave? And the same had I, your haughty parents. I do disdain them poor, ill-got riches I do deny.</li>
<li>And honest heart-lovers far superior, your gold and riches will soon decay. It was naked we came, and to this world, love, and much saved, we will go away, go away.</li>
