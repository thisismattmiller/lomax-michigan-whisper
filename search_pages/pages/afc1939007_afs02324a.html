<li>A.F.S. recording number two, three, two, four. Side A, strips one and two.</li>
<li>You say this sailor was sailing on the vessels and he made this song about the big list?</li>
<li>Yeah, he was sailing on the big list.</li>
<li>Why do you suppose he composed it? To make up for them being beaten like that?</li>
<li>No, it was just kind of a jokey song you like, you know, because they got beat, see?</li>
<li>They said they'd beat the fleet, that they'd hold two, that means teeth in the wind and wait.</li>
<li>They'd hold two and wait. That's just a laugh, that makes it kind of fun.</li>
<li>And you said they stopped someplace?</li>
<li>They stopped to a whorehouse. I didn't say a whorehouse, you know.</li>
<li>Over here in Camargo, there was a small ship that was back in the city.</li>
<li>There was a fellow there, there was a fellow there, there was a fellow there, there was a fellow there, there was a fellow there.</li>
<li>I know him well, he was Mickey Robinson.</li>
<li>He had a whorehouse there. It was a place called Kintown.</li>
<li>They stopped there and they drank a little bit of beer and they did something.</li>
<li>They didn't say they screwed the whores, but something they had done to the whores.</li>
<li>They had a great time, something like that, a good time with the whores, something like that.</li>
<li>And then they went aboard, and then they went aboard, and then they went aboard, and then they went aboard,</li>
<li>and then started on their route.</li>
<li>And it tells, it rhymes, and it goes along, see?</li>
<li>But I couldn't tell it because I don't know it.</li>
<li>What about this Red Iron Ore song?</li>
<li>Well, that was done by a fellow aboard that vessel.</li>
<li>What vessel?</li>
<li>Board of the Navy.</li>
<li>What about when was that?</li>
<li>You know what time it was?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>That was in 1880, 1880.</li>
<li>I remember that song, I remember when it got out.</li>
<li>Did you do it?</li>
<li>Did you sing it now?</li>
<li>Well, I just sang it.</li>
<li>Well, I mean the Red Iron Ore.</li>
<li>Well, I can sing it, yeah.</li>
<li>Yeah, well, I'll just go ahead and sing it now.</li>
<li>Give me a square of that bottle, yeah.</li>
<li>Are you ready?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>How low is that, brother?</li>
<li>I'll sing you a few little first songs after a while if I can.</li>
<li>I'll get it after a while, I'll get it.</li>
<li>I want to get the first of it.</li>
<li>Come, come, come, come.</li>
