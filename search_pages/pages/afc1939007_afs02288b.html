<li>2288 B. 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>Oh, come all you jolly lambs, and so watch here at your ease,</li>
<li>and who do you think of the trouble and woes that happened on the seas?</li>
<li>Concerning of the merchant ship and gallant man-of-war,</li>
<li>on the British way along the sea lies many years like a gallant soul.</li>
<li>Our vessel was laden with envy of gallant wine, returning homeward from the east,</li>
<li>for the river pool was bound.</li>
<li>A dreadful storm, a delay, a rise, a rigging, a toll away, our main mast cast off on decked boats, cast over with the waves.</li>
<li>Oh, and when she was sinking too long ago, we ran out, and one was heavy loaded,</li>
<li>and she surely tossed about; the other was heavy laden, and she filled and then went down,</li>
<li>and the waves were gassing o'er her side, and all our men were drowned.</li>
<li>We put in three days' provisions, which was made to serve as wine,</li>
<li>and looking for a harbor and a plinth one we did find.</li>
<li>And when we got one foot on board, and got one foot on land, it was such a sight it would do right.</li>
<li>We were weak, and we could not stand.</li>
<li>I am a fair maiden, lately left in bondage, and the things I will never deny, and it's all for the sake of a young collegian,</li>
<li>enthroning my true love to the light. My spirits are sunk, and my courage is low, and my eyesight is failing, and distracted I must go.</li>
<li>And it's all for the sake of my love from the east on, 'tis my love, oh, will thee, trainer, oh.</li>
<li>Oh, trainer, noble trainer, you are my darling, I wish I had never by your face,</li>
<li>for it's commonly reported throughout the whole nation, that you brought me two things into place.</li>
<li>My parents, they are angry, as I'm not wise, to be taking in hands like a foolish enterprise.</li>
<li>And besides, I am delighted by all the young minds here, my love will lead you, trainer, oh.</li>
<li>The very first sermon my true love did preach, it was in London, dirty, I didn't see. And the very next sermon my true love did preach, the world is so pretty, aren't they?</li>
<li>He was standing on the altar, the robes he did wear, his fine ruffle shirt and his pearly black hair.</li>
<li>From the heart of a fair maid, he would bring to his fair ear, my love will lead you, trainer, oh.</li>
<li>Then back to Newgate, I was brought bound down in Irish cocaine,</li>
<li>for plundering of riches shipped the seat down on the Spanish main.</li>
<li>It was the liquor and bed company that made the rake of me, now by the wear of my sad face and my curve on piracy.</li>
<li>And fair you will, you shady rose, and that girl that I adore.</li>
<li>Her voice like music, soft and sweet, will never cure me more.</li>
<li>And no more I'll kiss her ruby lips, or caress her early hands, for here I die, a scard for death, out again in a warm land.</li>
<li>Do you know, do you remember where you learnt that song at all?</li>
<li>The song, the true song I heard.</li>
<li>Oh, I think I learnt it from Irie Parker.</li>
<li>Who was he?</li>
<li>He was the father of my good girl from Lyon.</li>
<li>He's dead now, she's dead.</li>
<li>Was he a deep sleeper?</li>
<li>No, he was a middle man.</li>
<li>How do you know it was his song?</li>
<li>Oh, they tell that, the old folks.</li>
<li>Oh, yeah, sure.</li>
<li>I know a little of Firestone, but, but, well.</li>
<li>Turn it over to the other side.</li>
<li>Okay, okay, okay, okay.</li>
<li>Oh, as I went there walking one fine summer's morning, down London Street dying transfer to go.</li>
<li>I'd find a third and go see who's in my fancy. I'll tell you they've got it as far as I know.</li>
<li>Oh, this time only last season, where are you going?</li>
<li>Oh hey, your father, I'd like for you to know.</li>
<li>My father's a blacksmith in the village of Glasgow, and I am his daughter young.</li>
<li>Tell him I know, tell him I know, tell him I know, tell him I know.</li>
<li>Oh, as I won't lay last day into sleep to my fancy, for I have got buildings that everyone knows.</li>
<li>Oh, sweet young Johnny, go away, Mr. Johnny, for it's into your buildings I'm having trouble.</li>
<li>Oh, your buildings are shabby, so go away, Mr. Johnny, for it's into your buildings I'm having trouble.</li>
<li>You may kiss me and court me and then go and leave me, and then you will laugh at, and then you will laugh at young Johnny.</li>
<li>Oh, the sun is a jet that's too bright in the morning, and an early wintry for the jet wind to blow.</li>
<li>It's the rightest season for it, go away, I'm losing my charming, my dandy son, Jesse.</li>
