<li>AFS recording number 2345, side A, strips 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>You told me you fought in the war, and oh, how the bullets did fly.</li>
<li>I think it's too bad, you're always so sad, for the bullets, they all pass you by.</li>
<li>Not always the bullets that kill, though sometimes a prey the will,</li>
<li>but a maiden so fair, with her beauty so rare, with a face like the angels above,</li>
<li>she applied her true love to me, beneath the old apple tree.</li>
<li>But her love passed away, and my heart broke that day, it's not always the bullets that kill.</li>
<li>A slender form entered the doorway, and a sweet gentle voice cried, Roy,</li>
<li>can't you see that my poor heart is breaking?</li>
<li>I heard what you said to my boy, I married your brother.</li>
<li>For we had both heard, To save the flag you gave your life,</li>
<li>it was all a mistake, and you came too late.</li>
<li>Those words cut our hearts like a knife, it's not always the bullets that kill,</li>
<li>though sometimes a prey the will, but a maiden so fair, with her beauty so rare,</li>
<li>and a face like the angels above, she applied her true love to me,</li>
<li>beneath the old apple tree. My heart broke that day.</li>
<li>Not always the bullets that kill, though sometimes a prey the will,</li>
<li>but a maiden so fair, with her beauty so rare, the face like the angels above,</li>
<li>she applied her true love to me, beneath the old apple tree.</li>
<li>Washington, a year of '74.</li>
<li>To save myself from hell, boys, I couldn't find a whore.</li>
<li>At last I found the whore boys in the middle of a block.</li>
<li>To save myself from hell, boys, I couldn't find my cock.</li>
<li>At last I found my cock, boys, in the middle of my hand.</li>
<li>But to save myself from hell, boys, I couldn't make it stand.</li>
<li>At last I made it stand, boys, as straight up as a pin.</li>
<li>But to save myself from hell, boys, I couldn't push it in.</li>
<li>At last I drove it in, boys, clean up to the sprout.</li>
<li>But to save myself from hell, boys, I couldn't drag it out.</li>
<li>At last I dragged it out, boys, so scabby and so sore.</li>
<li>So I'll advise you right now, boys, to never fuck a whore.</li>
<li>Amen.</li>
<li>As I went walking one morning in spring, to hear the birds whistle</li>
<li>and the nightingale sing, I spied a fair damsel and sweetly she sang,</li>
<li>I'm going to be married next Monday morning.</li>
<li>I stepped up beside her and softly I said,</li>
<li>How old are you, darling, my charming fair maid?</li>
<li>Oh, to live in yon valley, yon valley so green.</li>
<li>I'll be sixteen years old next Monday morning.</li>
<li>Now sixteen years old is too young for to marry?</li>
<li>I pray you, my fair one, you have five years to tarry.</li>
<li>She said, You talk like a wild man, like a man without skill,</li>
<li>for I've now tarried five years against my own will,</li>
<li>and now I am determined to have my own fling,</li>
<li>and I wish to my heart it was Monday morning.</li>
<li>Its next Monday morning will be my whole care,</li>
<li>to tie up my tresses, my bonny brown hair,</li>
<li>and six pretty fair ones, all dressed in their green,</li>
<li>will dance at my wedding next Monday morning.</li>
<li>Now next Monday night when I go to my bed,</li>
<li>I'll turn myself over to this man of a wed,</li>
<li>and I'll sober his body, my both legs I'll fling,</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
<li>(static crackling)</li>
