<li>2479A</li>
<li>Farmer went to his merchant, just to get some meat and milk.</li>
<li>Puffin merchant told the farmer, if you got boar we will in your field.</li>
<li>You got a good cotton crop, but it's just like shooting dice.</li>
<li>Now you gonna work the whole year round buddy, yet the cotton will be no price.</li>
<li>Now you go to the commissary, he will give you plenty meal and meat.</li>
<li>Just anything you want, it's in the falling.</li>
<li>You go to the commissary, he'll give you plenty meal and meat.</li>
<li>Now you give your half a price for your cotton, not a doggone thing for your feed.</li>
<li>That's too bad, too bad.</li>
<li>Yes boy, if I could get fifty cents a day. Yes boy, if I could get fifty cents a day.</li>
<li>And if they just raise me to a dollar, don't you know I'd give that crop away.</li>
<li>Play it one time.</li>
<li>Yeah man, play it, it don't cost you nothing.</li>
<li>I know these farmers, you see, that's why I'm telling you like I said.</li>
<li>You know, get in there.</li>
<li>Now boys, ain't but the one thing boys, that make me get in the thing.</li>
<li>When they mistreat me every time, it look like I just got to have another drink.</li>
<li>Yes boys, and I'm going away to stay.</li>
<li>Because I ain't going to let no merchant that is do me this way.</li>
<li>This song was composed in 1927 by Sampson Pidman.</li>
<li>At the condition that the farmer being treated at the shortage of their cotton, I thought in 30 that it was very necessary to put out a record of these things.</li>
<li>But I composed them for the necessity of the farmer.</li>
<li>It was very popular amongst everyone that heard it, and it became to be a true fact, everyone well known.</li>
<li>This is it. Live in Arkansas.</li>
