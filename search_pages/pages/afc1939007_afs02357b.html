<li>The wife began to hate the old man, more and more each day.</li>
<li>Once he heard the three declare the old fool's in the way.</li>
<li>They then agreed to send him to a poor house which was near.</li>
<li>When like a flash the black sheep's words came ringing in his ear.</li>
<li>Don't be angry with me dad, don't turn me from your door.</li>
<li>I know that I've been wayward but I won't be anymore.</li>
<li>Give to me another chance, just put me to the test.</li>
<li>You'll find the black sheep loves his dad far better than the red.</li>
<li>A wagon drives up to the door, it was the poor house man.</li>
<li>The brothers pointed to their dad saying sir there is your man.</li>
<li>Just then a manly farmer rose came pushing to the crowd saying stop you Bruce, you must</li>
<li>stop this, this cannot be allowed.</li>
<li>You stole this old man's property and all that he could save.</li>
<li>Take why you stole that little lot containing his wife's grave.</li>
<li>I am his son but not your kin from now till judgment day.</li>
<li>The old man grasped the black sheep's hand and the crowd then hear him say don't be angry</li>
<li>with me lad, I turned you from my door.</li>
<li>I know I was old and foolish, I've repented or and or.</li>
<li>I wish I had gave to you my gold for you have stood the test.</li>
<li>And I find the black sheep loved his dad far better than the red.</li>
<li>Well, down here the cows laid here in a little bark camp, I feel in bark and the boys got</li>
<li>singing it and I picked it up, well the name of Kelly, oh that was back in 1901.</li>
<li>It was to me but it's old I often heard of it but that's the first time I had heard</li>
<li>it then.</li>
<li>We were all working in there together and yes it seemed to be there that's why I took</li>
<li>a liking to it and I've learned it.</li>
<li>Besides Kelly was a good singer.</li>
