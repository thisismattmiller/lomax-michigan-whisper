<li>2271, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>First Captain and Miss Gallagher, a man so brave and young,</li>
<li>and his parents home that now must know his hiding of their sons.</li>
<li>It is in the pangs of sorrow that will pierce a mother's heart,</li>
<li>as the early time has come so soon for boys from her must part.</li>
<li>'Twas but a few short weeks before, when in it he had said,</li>
<li>There's a place down in Lake Urine that will not give up its dead.</li>
<li>It is called a sailor's graveyard, those words he was known to say,</li>
<li>as he stood out on the Eccleston deck and showed them where it lay.</li>
<li>We had then three more friends, our gods were in its company,</li>
<li>right upon the island and that followed up the sea.</li>
<li>'Twas Anthony, McDonough, Joe Scheid, and Peter Byrne.</li>
<li>We hoped to meet them all again and wish their glad return.</li>
<li>Young Anthony, a mate on board, he had sailed the ocean blue.</li>
<li>He had came back to the Great Lakes and had joined the Eccleston crew</li>
<li>to be among companions of his early boyhood days.</li>
<li>He was doomed like many boys on board until the sailors lay.</li>
<li>Among our four companions on the Eccleston that were drowned,</li>
<li>Joe Scheid was the only one of them was ever found.</li>
<li>Their lifeless forms in silence now are missing forever, forever, forever, forever.</li>
<li>It is well for us to think upon the words that God has said.</li>
<li>As we're told from all the scriptures, we should not forget the dead.</li>
<li>You may know at your bedside when the quiet shadows fall,</li>
<li>and in your prayer remember those who were once among us all.</li>
<li>And ask that ye may gather with the angels in their flight,</li>
<li>and forget the steamer clippin' and the dark September night.</li>
<li>How long ago did you make this up, Mr. Byrne?</li>
<li>A year after, a year after about six months after.</li>
<li>Did you write it down as you made it up, make it up all at once?</li>
<li>I made it up all at once. I didn't write it down until I had it all made up.</li>
<li>How long did it take you to make it up?</li>
<li>Oh, gosh, I don't know, maybe, well, I thought it was worse maybe in one day and maybe be a week again.</li>
<li>I would think of another one, maybe a month had it like that.</li>
<li>But if I sat down and opened it, I just kept thinking of it, you know,</li>
<li>and what happened about that in about a month while I made the whole song up at school.</li>
<li>It took me about a month.</li>
<li>It took you a month all together. And then you wrote it down.</li>
<li>Then I wrote it down.</li>
<li>Uh-huh. Have you sung it very often?</li>
<li>Not very often, no. No, I never sang it.</li>
<li>Have you sung it anywhere outside of Beaver Island?</li>
<li>No, I haven't, no, no. No.</li>
