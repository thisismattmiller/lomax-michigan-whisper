<li>2286, A-1 and 2.</li>
<li>I am sitting on the East Isle of Mary</li>
<li>Where we sat side by side</li>
<li>On a bright May morning long ago</li>
<li>When first you were my bride</li>
<li>The corn was springing fresh and green</li>
<li>And the dark clouds sang on high</li>
<li>And the red was on your lip, Mary</li>
<li>And they loved lighting your eyes</li>
<li>And it brought a step down yonder lane</li>
<li>Where the little church stands near</li>
<li>The place where we were wed, Mary</li>
<li>I can see the fire from here</li>
<li>But the graveyard lies between Mary</li>
<li>And a step might break your wrist</li>
<li>As I lead you, darling, down</li>
<li>To sleep with your babe upon your breast</li>
<li>And I'm very lonely now, Mary</li>
<li>For the poor makes a few new friends</li>
<li>But oh, I love them better, for</li>
<li>They feel proper father to them</li>
<li>For they say there's bread and work for all</li>
<li>And in summer all was there</li>
<li>But I won't forget old Ireland</li>
<li>If it was twenty-two times as fair</li>
<li>And oft times in those grand old woods</li>
<li>I will sit and shut my eyes</li>
<li>And my mind will travel back again</li>
<li>To the place where Mary lies</li>
<li>And I think I will see that little style</li>
<li>Where we sat side by side</li>
<li>On that bright May morning long ago</li>
<li>When first you were my bride</li>
<li>Johnny came down the other night</li>
<li>He said he'd come to see me</li>
<li>Instead of that the son of a bitch</li>
<li>He came down to deceive me</li>
<li>Gone again to Royaddy, gone again to Royay</li>
<li>He took me by the slender waist</li>
<li>And on the bed he threw me</li>
<li>The damnedest thing that I've ever seen</li>
<li>Sure, Johnny pulled out and showed me</li>
<li>Gone again to Royaddy, gone again to Royay</li>
<li>He said it was a leather gun</li>
<li>And asked me how did it suit me</li>
<li>He placed the medal between my legs</li>
<li>And swore to Christ he'd shoot me</li>
<li>Gone again to Royaddy, gone again to Royay</li>
<li>He began to load and fire as fast as he was able</li>
<li>Every time he hit this spot, this spot, this spot, this spot, this spot, this spot</li>
<li>Right below my navel</li>
<li>Gone again to Royaddy, gone again to Royay</li>
<li>He began to load and fire as fast as he was able</li>
<li>All right, all right, all right</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
