<li>2, 3, 4, 1, side B.</li>
<li>I'll paint you a picture from cellar, and I'll hang it o'er your door.</li>
<li>A truer and better signboard than ever you had before.</li>
<li>I'll paint you the skill of a master, and many shall pause to see</li>
<li>this wonderful piece of painting so full of reality.</li>
<li>I'll paint you yourself from cellar as you wait for that fair young boy</li>
<li>just in the hour of manhood among his pride and joy.</li>
<li>He has no thought of stopping, but to greet him with a smile</li>
<li>and seem so blithe and friendly, he paused to chat awhile.</li>
<li>I'll paint you again from cellar, I'll paint you as you stand</li>
<li>with a foaming glass of lily, extended in each hand.</li>
<li>He waves, butchers him, drink, fetch me just this one,</li>
<li>and he lifts that glass and grinds it, and the hellish work is done.</li>
<li>Next, I'll paint a drunkard, only one year has flown,</li>
<li>but into that lonesome creature that fair young boy has grown.</li>
<li>The work was quick and rapid, I will paint him as he lies</li>
<li>in a torpid, drunken slumber under the wintry skies.</li>
<li>Next, I'll paint the form of a mother that she kneels at her darling's side,</li>
<li>her beautiful boy that was dearer than all the world beside.</li>
<li>I'll paint the shape of a coffin, labeled with the one word lost,</li>
<li>and I'll paint all this from cellar and paint it free of cost,</li>
<li>the sin and the shame and the sorrows, the crime and the want and the woe</li>
<li>that is borne away at the Murphy Hotel, no hand can paint you no.</li>
<li>But I'll paint you a signboard, and many shall pause to see</li>
<li>this wonderful, this wonderful, this wonderful, this wonderful,</li>
<li>this wonderful painting so full of reality.</li>
<li>Now think before you drink. He who thinks before he drinks</li>
<li>shall nothing drink but water, and he who drinks before he thinks</li>
<li>shall drink what no man ought it.</li>
<li>Ah, young man, ah, young man.</li>
<li>God, man, he'll roll, come down the South, and he'll come down, oh, no.</li>
<li>(static crackling)</li>
