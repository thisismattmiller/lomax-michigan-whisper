<li>AFS recording number 2326, slide A strips 1 and 2.</li>
<li>When we got to the bridge we couldn't get across on the kind of the engines.</li>
<li>They were coming so fast, you know, and they wouldn't stop for nobody or nothing.</li>
<li>You know how the engines run, when they go, they go, that's all, the fired engines.</li>
<li>And running over people in those stages of awful tragedy, the worst I've ever seen in my life.</li>
<li>And we could see the people dropping off in the fire escape, dropping onto the ground, dropping to their death.</li>
<li>But we didn't get across that night at all.</li>
<li>We went back, when the fire was all done, we went back to our vessels.</li>
<li>And the next morning we went over and we could see the people laying out there on the ground dead, you know,</li>
<li>with blankets over them, some of them coats over them, over their heads.</li>
<li>Some all burnt, their heads burnt off and their arms burnt off and their legs burnt off.</li>
<li>Some they couldn't tell who they were or anything like that, they couldn't tell nothing.</li>
<li>Couldn't identify them at all.</li>
<li>Hundreds and hundreds of them.</li>
<li>And they were still pulling them out yet, for me it was there, out of the ashes and debris, dead bodies, you know, burnt.</li>
<li>The worst sight I wouldn't want to ever see again.</li>
<li>When was this?</li>
<li>1884.</li>
<li>On the 17th day of February.</li>
<li>Did you learn, who did you learn the song from?</li>
<li>Well, I learned just by hearing people singing it afterwards, you know.</li>
<li>It was made up in Milwaukee, I found that.</li>
<li>Was it composed right after the second?</li>
<li>I heard the song less than a year after that.</li>
<li>How many people were killed in that song?</li>
<li>The nearest they could find out, it was one thousand people.</li>
<li>One thousand people?</li>
<li>The nearest they could figure, a lot of them burnt, so they couldn't get them, see, they burnt the ashes.</li>
<li>But they got them, in a way, they got them by who was there, see, through their parents.</li>
<li>That is the estimation.</li>
<li>Well, what was this play, did you ever see it?</li>
<li>Did you ever see this play?</li>
<li>Played on the stage?</li>
<li>No, did you ever see the play, the two orphans, afterwards?</li>
<li>No, no, I never seen it at all played.</li>
<li>You see it because they never played anymore.</li>
<li>The two orphans never played no more.</li>
<li>Did the cast get burned up too, the players, the actors?</li>
<li>Well, everybody put near, there was one thousand they claimed was burnt.</li>
<li>Oh, I guess they were, they were started on the stage, the fire did, so they must have been burnt.</li>
<li>Sure, they was burnt.</li>
<li>We never heard about them, about the actors.</li>
<li>They'd be the first ones to be burnt.</li>
<li>All ready?</li>
<li>Young Edwin, his feelings no longer could control. He lay from his ambush and seized her fair hand.</li>
<li>Oh, Mary, oh, Mary, with a joyous in my heart, no more in this wide world until death we will part.</li>
<li>Next day the bands of sweet wedlock was tied, and Mary became this young warrior's fair bride.</li>
<li>The next day they so happy, together they were seen, a-walking along for the banks of the green.</li>
