<li>AFS recording number 2333, side A.</li>
<li>My years, don't go by so easily. You may be here, I'm coming for my share. I remember the words ever spoken, by four years, young as you're there.</li>
<li>As congratulations may happen, to pick from the best in the land. And the girl I cherished and my sweetheart was known as my blue velvet band.</li>
<li>For a night coming all wet and deep, on the wing of an old duty dog. I thought I heard someone a-talking, so I stopped and remained by the door.</li>
<li>Now he's the finest young man in the country. He's the proudest young man in the land. And just as a piece of the key, oh my sweetheart, she gave him her hand.</li>
<li>Now if I be a man to be suspected, and I'll be free as you. When the cold floor heat bore in my hands, I foretold my way is through you.</li>
<li>Now he took a business like mine, to the colt that held in my hand. For he sprang out the window and left me, alone with my blue velvet band.</li>
<li>And just as I stepped up beside her, she gave me me a modern smile. Helping that I entered my places, and I held in the blue velvet band.</li>
<li>Now I'm a convict with a hard reputation. Twenty years I'm a suit like a man. For the bullet I fired in Santa, through the heart of my blue velvet band.</li>
<li>One evening as darkness was clearing, I found myself close to the bar. I thought I heard someone a-singing, way up in that ocean of stars.</li>
<li>The music rang down from the heavens, while sweeter than the earth on land. And the song that was sang by the angels, was sang by my blue velvet band.</li>
<li>When the kinds of fires go back to Kentucky, let 'em know there that I'm still a man. With the cold floor heat boring my bullets, I'll be with the blue velvet band.</li>
