<li>AFS recording number two, three, four, five, side B, strips one and two.</li>
<li>Oh, stars in the streets of North Dakota, workin' a time for a ball trailer, find Calgo on a Minneapolis just for a look on a big space fair.</li>
<li>Buy me bottles, buy me tickets, dress me up like Outer Sight, yelp me on one zimby old wagon, feel the good I feel for fights.</li>
<li>The next morning when I wake up, buy some fellas that they call the Bulls, just one, one for a bunch before you been so goddamn full.</li>
<li>Oh, they took me, load me in the big blue wagon, take me up on a judge you see, the judge you say, ten dollars a swan free.</li>
<li>You've been on the hell of a spree. Oh, I look in my pocket and I have no pangas, judge you say, you can get no bail.</li>
<li>So all that's left for this poor sweet man, go ten days in the county yale.</li>
<li>So I think I'll go back to North Dakota, find a job on a farm somewhere, and all I can say for you sweet fellas, coo to hell with the big space fair.</li>
<li>This was in the year 1883 when I was on the drive working under Silver Jack, who is now in Jackson.</li>
<li>We're all laying on the bank smoking this nigger head tobacco, waiting for the flood to clear the ground.</li>
<li>You heard someone speaking, he was speaking on compound, he said the Bible was a fable, shown as clear as day.</li>
<li>There's no such a place as hell existed. Well, we all allowed it looked that way.</li>
<li>You're a liar, someone shouted, and you have to take it back. We all looked up surprisingly, it was the voice of Silver Jack.</li>
<li>Because under that religion my mother lived and died, although I've not always used them right, when I hear a man abuse them and he's got to eat his words or bite.</li>
<li>Well, they fought for 40 minutes, for 40 minutes or more, till at last Jack lost a tooth or two, and Bob pulled off an ear, till at last Jack got him under, and he sluped him once or twice.</li>
<li>Then Bobby did declare the divinity of Christ.</li>
