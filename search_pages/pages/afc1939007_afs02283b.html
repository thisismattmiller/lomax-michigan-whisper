<li>My Connors peaks are as a Rudy as morning, the brightest of pearls, but they make it see,</li>
<li>with an acre, an acre with ringlets as my brow adorning, and love's cupid both string,</li>
<li>and roses as breath, smiling, beguiling, cheering, endearing. Together oft over the mountains we</li>
<li>strain, by each other delighted, and fondly united, and I listen all day too, my dear Irish Spies.</li>
<li>Now the war is all over, and my love has not returned, and I'm afraid that some envious plot</li>
<li>has been laid, and that some cruel goddess has him captivated, and that left me to mourn,</li>
<li>hey dear Irish maid, and the smiling, beguiling, cheering, endearing, and together oft over the</li>
<li>mountains we strain, by each other delighted, and fondly united, I would listen all day too,</li>
<li>my dear Irish Spies.</li>
<li>My parents lived in the convicts, they were of a high degree, and they dearly adored</li>
<li>me, for they had no child but me, and I raked a boundless pleasure for my fancy way, and now</li>
<li>I'm bound and fancy, and I'm sorry for the fate. A lady out of Holland, she came to meet me there,</li>
<li>and she offered me high wages for to work for her one year, we then struck up a bargain,</li>
<li>and with her I did agree, and now I'm off to Holland, for to dine my misery, I had not been</li>
<li>in Holland more than a half a year, when my looted mistress got very fond of me, she said,</li>
<li>my gold and silver, my houses and free land, if you agree to marry me, well, yes, you can, man.</li>
<li>Oh, Mr. dear, excuse me, for I cannot wed you now, for I'm already promised, and beside</li>
<li>a solemn vow, for I'm an gauge to Molly, your handsome waiting maid. Now, mistress, dear,</li>
<li>excuse me, for she has my heart be preyed, and with an angry countenance away from me, she flew,</li>
<li>and she thought that she would be revving and prove my overthrow,</li>
<li>her vow she hath kept faithful, and that I know it's true. Well, one morning in the garden, I was</li>
<li>taking my place there, and my mistress followed after a while viewing the leaflet, and the little</li>
<li>ring off her finger, just as she passed me by, she slipped into my pocket, and for the same I died,</li>
<li>and the day that I was hung, lovely Molly played her part, which dung my cruel mistress into my</li>
<li>very heart. Rich jewels and gold rings, lovely Molly does enjoy, but it was her whole vexation,</li>
<li>the loss of her darling boy.</li>
<li>Yeah, that's the one. Well, that's a strange song. I suppose women do like that sometimes.</li>
<li>They do, don't they?</li>
<li>Did you ever hear of a...</li>
<li>Okay, all right.</li>
