<li>Only part he has gone from the wars of the fighting, he has gone to the place where he'll</li>
<li>never take delight in, oh he looked to the east, to that great Mount Deanna that brought</li>
<li>him o'er to die on the Isle of St. Helena, only part has a wife, poor Louise how she</li>
<li>mourns of her husband's departure, oh she dreams when she sleeps of her last broken hearted,</li>
<li>and she looked to the east to that great Mount Deanna that took her husband o'er to die on</li>
<li>the Isle of St. Helena, oh Bonnie had a son, he was brave and was manly, he swore he'd</li>
<li>bring his father home from the Isle of St. Helena, oh he looked to the east to that great</li>
<li>Mount Deanna that took his father o'er to die on the Isle of St. Helena, what was the</li>
<li>great Mount Deanna, the great Mount Deanna was a party that took him there, just like</li>
<li>our government see, here understand, if you've done anything wrong and there's an island</li>
<li>where they put you there to die like there's an ocean you know St. Helena Island, instead</li>

<li>and the government is a great Mount Deanna, and when did this happen about you know, oh</li>
<li>you ever read the history of Napoleon of Bonaparte, well it must be a few hundred years ago and</li>
<li>I couldn't tell you the time, he was a great warrior, and I'll tell you what he used to</li>
<li>do, if some country like Germany would try to take some poor little country that wasn't</li>
<li>tended, tend to this country see, and make him do as they want him to do you know, work</li>
<li>to them and all that and take him over, well he'd go and he'd fight for that country, he'd</li>
<li>lick Germany see, he'd fight for that country, he had an army of his own you know, and he</li>
<li>was very rich and that country would pay him, when he'd lick Germany, that country would</li>
<li>pay him for what he'd done for them, and Germany also would have to pay him too for the expenses</li>
<li>see, for his expenses see, where did he have his army, is it, where was his army located,</li>
<li>in France, oh he was a Frenchman you know, yeah, no no, but he just, he went out for</li>
<li>himself see, and he got an army and just, that's all he ever done was just watching</li>
<li>countries see, and making his money that way, who was Louise, Louise was his wife, what</li>
<li>was his son's name, well it didn't mention his son's name, because Boni had a son, he</li>
<li>was brave and manly see, before he'd bring his father home from the Isle of St. Helene.</li>
