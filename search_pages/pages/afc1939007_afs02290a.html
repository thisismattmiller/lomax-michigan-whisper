<li>2290A.</li>
<li>It was once that I was courted by a bonny Irish boy.</li>
<li>He called me a jewel, his heart's delight and joy.</li>
<li>It was in Dublin City, that place of noted fame,</li>
<li>where first my bonny Irish boy, of courting me, came.</li>
<li>His cheeks was red as roses, his hair was ill-light brown,</li>
<li>his golden locks and ringlets hung o'er his shoulders down,</li>
<li>his feet as white as ivory, his eyes as black as flow,</li>
<li>and he breaks the heart of all the girls wherever he may go.</li>
<li>A long time I kept his company and hoped to be his wife,</li>
<li>but now he's gone and left me to cross the region's tide.</li>
<li>And I'm afraid some other fair maid my true love would enjoy,</li>
<li>while I am left lamenting for my bonny Irish boy.</li>
<li>But I'll pack up my clothing and in search of him I'll go.</li>
<li>I'll wander for my true love's sake through rain, wind, frost and snow.</li>
<li>When I'm sick, sore and sorry, I will sit down and cry,</li>
<li>when I think of the joys I had with my bonny Irish boy.</li>
<li>When I am dead and gone, there's one request I crave,</li>
<li>take my bones to Ireland and lay them in the grave.</li>
<li>Those words write on my tombstone to let all pastors by,</li>
<li>know that I died quite brokenhearted for my bonny, bonny, bonny.</li>
<li>I learned that when I was 17 years of age in the London War.</li>
