<li>2425B is spoiled. Here's 2426A.</li>
<li>This song was composed by Fred Carrier.</li>
<li>It was in Old Western, in Old Western shores</li>
<li>Where lived a young Denzel so handsome and fair</li>
<li>She was courted by a young man who called her his dear</li>
<li>And was known as a traitor, a ship carpenter</li>
<li>The King wanted seaman to go up on sea</li>
<li>What caused this young Denzel to sob and to say</li>
<li>Oh William, oh William, don't you go on sea</li>
<li>Or don't you remember what you told me</li>
<li>Early in the morning before it was day</li>
<li>He called upon her and those words she did say</li>
<li>Come Polly, come Polly, come along with me</li>
<li>Before we get married our friends for to see</li>
<li>Let her through mountains and valleys so deep</li>
<li>What caused this young Denzel to sob and to weep</li>
<li>She sobbed and she wept, those words she did say</li>
<li>I'm afraid to my heart you have led me astray</li>
<li>'Tis true, 'tis true, young William did say</li>
<li>For many long nights I've been digging your grave</li>
<li>When she saw her grave open and the spade lying by</li>
<li>She wrung her poor hands and most bitterly cried</li>
<li>Oh pardon, oh pardon, pretty Polly did say</li>
<li>I live no longer than to become your wife</li>
<li>I'll sail this world round and set you quite free</li>
<li>If you'll only will pardon my sweet baby knee</li>
<li>No pardon, no pardon, there is no time to stand</li>
<li>And for the time had drew a knife to hand</li>
<li>He pierced her through the heart till her life blood it flowed</li>
<li>And into her grave her sweet body did crawl</li>
<li>He covered her over so snug and secure</li>
<li>So no one would find her he thought he'd made sure</li>
<li>He jumped upon board ship to sail this world round</li>
<li>Before this young murder would ever be found</li>
<li>He had not sailed for over a day</li>
<li>When the captain came up and those words he did say</li>
<li>There's a murder on deck boys and the deed has been done</li>
<li>And the ship must be hunted or cannot sail on</li>
<li>Up steps a sailor who says it's not me</li>
<li>Up steps another and the same he did say</li>
<li>Up steps young William who stamped and he swore</li>
<li>And he says it's not me I will vow and declare</li>
<li>As he was returning from the captain would speak</li>
<li>He met pretty Polly which made his heart bleed</li>
<li>She ripped and she told him</li>
<li>She ripped, she ripped, she ripped, she ripped him in three</li>
<li>Saying this is for, this is for the murder of sweet Babiney</li>
<li>I've composed the biggest part of that.</li>
<li>I composed. I got it in Kennedy like I told you.</li>
<li>I was all alone into a shack, into a shack.</li>
