<li>I took her in my arms and embraced her with a kiss this week, saying, Love, tell me the reason of why you were here.</li>
<li>Oh, why you were so severe, you must have some other suitor that's more pleasing to your mind than me.</li>
<li>And it's not the time to go, boys, to go boys, to go away. It's not the time to go, brave boys, we'll boot about it on today.</li>
<li>Oh, I called for a bottle of brandy for to drink in my love's company, but she felt so proud and sassy she would not take one drop from me.</li>
<li>She made me take love easy and not be so severe. She made me take love easy like the dew that's falling up the under trees.</li>
<li>And it's not the time to go, boys, to go boys, to go away. It's not the time to go, brave boys, we'll boot about it on today.</li>
<li>O landlady, my darling, come fill us one bottle with tea. I will pay you too a farthing, my darling, indeed, indeed.</li>
<li>Here's a health to all my suitors who cause my poor heart to bleed. And it's not the time to go, boys, to go boys, to go away.</li>
<li>It's not the time to go, brave boys, we'll boot about it on today.</li>
<li>Once I had my money plenty when I roamed about, but now my pockets are empty and the most of my credit's out.</li>
<li>And now's the time to go, boys, to go boys, to go away. Oh, now's the time to go, brave boys, we'll boot no more.</li>
<li>It's a breaking day.</li>
<li>Is that just the way you heard that song?</li>
