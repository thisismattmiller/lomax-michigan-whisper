<li>a.</li>
<li>A</li>
<li>Now when you do the double shuffle, honey, you've got to lead that way.</li>
<li>Joe Louis fights all comers, from big shots down to bums, it makes them any different.</li>
<li>They all go when the wagons come, you know the shuffle, T-Rail has got that swag.</li>
<li>Now when you do the double shuffle, honey, you've got to lead that way.</li>
<li>Now here come Jack Shockey, Joe knocked him on his floor, he heard the bell ringing, couldn't</li>
<li>get up to fight anymore, he knows the shuffle, T-Rail has got that swag.</li>
<li>Now when you do the double shuffle, honey, you've got to lead that way.</li>
<li>Now here come Max Mellon, chopped Joe Louis on his chin, but Mellon won't need no telling,</li>
<li>when he meets with Joe Louis again, he knows the shuffle, T-Rail has got that swag.</li>
<li>Now when you do the double shuffle, honey, you've got to lead that way.</li>
<li>[Music]</li>
<li>This song was composed by Samson Kidman, 19 and 34, the 15th of March, under the halves</li>
<li>of Joe Louis, for the people that want to hear a composure of Joe Louis.</li>
<li>And Roswell, Arkansas is my home, Calvin Freed, guitar with you.</li>
