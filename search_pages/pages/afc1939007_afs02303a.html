<li>He mounted on a milling white horse, he mounted on another</li>
<li>And they rode along together like a sister and a brother</li>

<li>and she makes her living by the sweat on her tail and it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, that little lady, she's got a little thing and if it's my Peter like a diamond ring then it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, but God I won't whistle and I'm sure I will sing for the horror boys are picking up my diamond rings and it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off, off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, I went out the other night to get a little screw, I got a dose of shankers and a blue ball too, then it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, I've been through Cuba and I've been through Spain, I'm a little jazz baby from the battleship Maine.</li>
<li>Then it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, but God I won't whistle and I'm sure I will sing for the horror boys are picking up my diamond rings and it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, I'm smoking cigarettes and I'm pulling my put, the doctor said it's killing me but for God it's doing me good.</li>
<li>Then it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>Oh, I thought I had to piss and I stepped through the trough and the head of my pecker, she fell clean off, then it's oh, oh, baby, take your leg off of mine.</li>
<li>There's a fine boarding house on the shores of Dark Lake where boar-fucking-larop would fit on your plate.</li>
<li>And boar-fucking-larop was sure to be there and in the rank butter you'd always find here.</li>
<li>Dearie die, oh day, you quack foul the die, oh diddle, oh day.</li>
<li>Oh, our cook, she's the daughter of honest John Clark, one taste of her biscuits would make a knock fart.</li>
<li>Her puddings are tough and as green as the grass and if you would taste them you'd hock off your ass, dearie die, oh day.</li>
<li>Quack foul the die, oh diddle, oh day.</li>
<li>Oh, there's Peter, Joe, William, there's Frankfort and Knox and there's sweet little Mary with a wart on her twat.</li>
<li>There's Jumper, our pushy, he's a good one too, but the long-legged bastard, he's shitting our shoes, dearie die, oh day.</li>
<li>Quack foul the die, oh diddle, oh day.</li>
<li>Oh dear to Tadminton, the son of a bitch, may his bollocks rot off with a seven-year itch.</li>
<li>On the part of a screw, when his arse hold a whistle, the red, white, and blue, dearie die, oh day.</li>
<li>Quack foul the die, oh diddle, oh day.</li>
<li>That's all of it.</li>
<li>How was your morning?</li>
