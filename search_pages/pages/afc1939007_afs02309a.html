<li>Oh, as I walked out one evening, just as the sun went down.</li>
<li>As I walked out one evening, just as the sun went down,</li>
<li>so carelessly I wandered till I come to a trenching town.</li>
<li>I heard two maids conversing, so slowly I passed on.</li>
<li>One said to love the farmer's boy, and the other one the mossback's son.</li>
<li>I heard two maids conversing, so slowly I passed on.</li>
<li>One said to love the shanty boy, and the other one the mossback's son.</li>
<li>The one that loved the mossback's son to the other girl did say,</li>
<li>The reason why I love him at home with me he'll say.</li>
<li>He'll stay at home all winter 'til the woods he would not go.</li>
<li>And when the spring did open his land he'd plow and sow.</li>
<li>He'd stay at home all winter 'til the woods he would not go.</li>
<li>And when the spring did open his land he'd plow and sow.</li>
<li>All for the plow and sow your land, so the other girl did say.</li>
<li>If crops had truly failed, your debt you could not pay.</li>
<li>If crops should prove a failure and grain market being low.</li>
<li>All kinds of turf he'll sell you out, but if he's a debt you owe.</li>
<li>All for the turf is telling yourself that there's not me a-learn.</li>
<li>There's no use of being debt when you're on a good farm.</li>
<li>You can raise your bread up from the land and not work through storms of rain.</li>
<li>For the shanty boy he works each day, his family's to maintain.</li>
<li>How you do brag when the shanty boy or the other girl did say.</li>
<li>He goes to the woods all winter and there he will not stay.</li>
<li>He goes to the woods in the winter and the spring and he comes home.</li>
<li>His money's so free he'll share with me and I'll spend he has none.</li>
<li>I know I bragged on the shanty boy that goes off in the fall.</li>
<li>He's both hot, he's tough and able, he's fit to stand the squall.</li>
<li>How welcome I'll receive him in the spring when he comes home.</li>
<li>His money's so free he'll share with me, but the mossback he's got none.</li>
<li>Well how I have bragged on the mass mossback boy or the other girl did say.</li>
<li>No stop a minute.</li>
<li>Yeah, how you do brag on the moss.</li>
<li>I have bragged on the mossback boy or the other girl did say.</li>
<li>If he should dash, oh, if ever I'd be free from the mossback stone of the shanty.</li>
<li>I know I bragged on the mossback boy or the other girl did say, if ever I get free from</li>
<li>the mossback stone with the shanty boy I'll go.</li>
<li>I'll leave a broken heart in this buckwheat fart of soul.</li>
<li>I have bragged on the mossback boy or the other girl did say.</li>
