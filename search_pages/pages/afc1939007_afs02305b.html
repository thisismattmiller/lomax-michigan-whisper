<li>23.05 B1 & 2</li>
<li>I will tell you what it is and what the folks learning.</li>
<li>I'll tell you where it comes from and where I got my learning.</li>
<li>Oh I'm right from old Virginia there's where they get all the great men.</li>
<li>My name is Pumpet Smash, I'm the principal of statesmen.</li>
<li>Oh I'm second best enough and you'll be half beside the sun.</li>
<li>And the way without my head, by God, were you half a ton.</li>
<li>Oh I'll tell you about a fight for the head of David Crockett.</li>
<li>He was half coon, half horse, half skyrocket.</li>
<li>Oh I met him one day when I was going to gunning.</li>
<li>Only asked him why he was going and he said he's going to cooning.</li>
<li>Only asked him why he's gone and he said he had none.</li>
<li>Says I, Colonel Davies, help me hunt at that one.</li>
<li>Oh, says he, Pumpet Smash, come and go along with Davy.</li>
<li>And he will show you how to run a coony crazy.</li>
<li>Oh I followed right after till I seen a squirrel</li>
<li>sitting on the pine knot eating sheep's arl.</li>
<li>Oh Colonel Davy said, He already must be dead.</li>
<li>For I thought I'd seen the bark flying all around his head.</li>
<li>Oh we both walked it up for the truth to the skipper.</li>
<li>We made a hell of a roast on Pumpet Smash's liver.</li>
<li>Oh there, said the pine knot, does big as a barrel.</li>
<li>Says I, Colonel Davy, did you call that a squirrel?</li>
<li>Says he, You black calf, it's better you don't laugh.</li>
<li>Rust pin your ears black and bite you two and a half.</li>
<li>Oh I threw down my gun, No, I'm my ammunition.</li>
<li>Says I, Colonel Davy, I'll cool your ambition.</li>
<li>Oh we both locked arms on a puppet-like steamer.</li>
<li>Says I, Colonel Davy, I'm a Tennessee screamer.</li>
<li>Oh I'm one of the best till they have the sight of the sun.</li>
<li>And I wailed out in the head by God with a half a ton.</li>
<li>Oh we fit the half a day.</li>
<li>Oh and then the grids stop it for I was badly whipped.</li>
<li>And so was David Crockett. Looked around for a head stunt and found them both missing.</li>
<li>He'd bit off mine and I'd swallowed his.</li>
<li>Oh then we did agree to let each other be.</li>
<li>For I wrote too much of him and so was he for me.</li>
<li>Oh then we did agree to let each other be.</li>
<li>For I wrote too much of him and so was he for me.</li>
<li>Where does that song come from?</li>
<li>I come from the camps.</li>
<li>You learned that in the camps too?</li>
<li>Yeah, learned that in the camps too.</li>
<li>The song was recorded by Lester Wells in Traverse City, September the 3rd, 1938,</li>
<li>for the Archives of American Folk Song in the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.</li>
<li>You Irish men, this wanted, oh you Irish hearts undaunted, returning to the shanty all before</li>
<li>your youth declines. For the spectators, they will ponder and they'll look upon us with wonder.</li>
<li>Our noise succeeds like thunder when we go and fall a fine.</li>
<li>The shanty is our station and it is our occupation. Each man is at his station,</li>
<li>no sum to score in line. Oh and it's eight foot of a block, we'll chip out at every knock,</li>
<li>and we'll cause the woods to shock at the falling of the pine. Oh and it's eight foot of a block,</li>
<li>we'll chip out at every knock, and we'll cause the woods to shock at the falling of the pine.</li>
<li>Just as the daylight break and from our clumbers we'll awaken. Our breakfast we have taken,</li>
<li>our axes we'll go grind. Oh it's far in the woods advance, for our axes clear just glance,</li>
<li>and like brothers we'll advance of days we'll go and fall the pine. Oh it's now the winter is finished,</li>
<li>from our shanties we're diminished. From our shanties we're diminished all for a little time.</li>
<li>Oh and it's far apart we're scattered, oh until to the bones we're gathered, where we will select</li>
<li>the timbers and some handsome rats to find. Oh and it's far apart we're scattered, oh until</li>
<li>to the bones we're gathered, where we will select the timbers and some handsome rats to find.</li>
<li>For a twin, for a twin.</li>
