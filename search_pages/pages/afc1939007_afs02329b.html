<li>India she's bound with a sweet and a pleasant gale, Jack the Prouder, Lofty, Sale, 52 to all natives on the shore.</li>
<li>Now come all you seamen foes, please pay attention to what you're told, and likewise pay attention unto me.</li>
<li>Take you a loving wife, love her as you love your life, and forever it is happy you will be.</li>
<li>You can lay her on her back like a cutter or a smack, you can roll her from the winder to the lee, you can hold her full and by, or as close as she will lie, and I guarantee she'll weather round Cape Horn.</li>
<li>Where did you learn that one? That's wobbly.</li>
<li>Yes, I did. He sang that 20 years ago, didn't he?</li>
<li>I learned it the same way I learned it.</li>
<li>That's a true song.</li>
<li>Oh, true as hell. The cat's got to help me. You've heard about it, eh?</li>
<li>And the weather roamed around the long Cape Horn.</li>
<li>You know the song I landed in Muskegon?</li>
<li>Huh?</li>
<li>Do you know that one?</li>
<li>No, I don't know. You spoke about it a while ago.</li>
<li>No, I don't know it.</li>
<li>Oh, home, home, dearest home, and it's home I love to be, home, dearest home, in my own country,</li>
<li>where the ash and the oak and the bunny birch tree, they're all a-growing green in this North American.</li>
<li>Oh, the sailor, the sailor being where -- seems to me there's something else before that now.</li>
<li>The sailor being weary, he hung down his head. He called for a candle to light him to bed.</li>
<li>Oh, he called for a candle as he used for to do. And to thee, my pretty fair maid, will you come along too.</li>
<li>Home, dearest home, and it's home I love to be, home, dearest home, in my own country,</li>
<li>where the ash and the oak and the bunny birch tree, they're all a-growing green in this North American.</li>
<li>Oh, she jumped in behind him to keep the sailor warm, wasn't thinking he'd do her any harm.</li>
<li>But what they'd done there, I'd never tell you here, but they wished that night was seven long years.</li>
<li>Home, dearest home, and it's home I love to be, home, dearest home, in my own country,</li>
<li>where the ash and the oak and the bunny birch tree --</li>
