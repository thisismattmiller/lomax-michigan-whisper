<li>2284A.</li>
<li>As I rode ashore last Sunday from my gallant rigging pain,</li>
<li>from the island of Jamaica where I'm so lightly hidden,</li>
<li>and carelessly I wandered, not caring where I went,</li>
<li>and towards a rigged plantation my steps I slowly bent,</li>
<li>and the orange trees decorated the fields with a green and yellow spot,</li>
<li>and occasionally my mind being filled with melon and cauliflower,</li>
<li>that when I'd get tired of rambling I would sit me down and rest,</li>
<li>and I was thinking of the little one at home and the one that I loved best.</li>
<li>Now my parents live in harmony, they are laboring at their ease,</li>
<li>but I am doing my foolishness to plow the raging seas,</li>
<li>and I am doing my foolishness to ramble night and day,</li>
<li>now I'll sing a song of old Ireland part, so I don't care away,</li>
<li>and now my song was up and I was feeling at my ease,</li>
<li>I also picked some oranges that grew up on the trees,</li>
<li>and there a female farm I spied that filled me with delight,</li>
<li>she wore the robes of innocence, her dress was snowy white,</li>
<li>and her dress was snowy white, my eyes bound round and trimmed with green,</li>
<li>and a silken scarf around her neck, her shoulders were two screens,</li>
<li>her hair on her shoulders is black as any clothes,</li>
<li>and her rolling eye attracted me, her cheeks were like the road,</li>
<li>I modestly saluted her, saying good morning, my pretty fair maid,</li>
<li>and with a kind reception, good morning, sir, she said,</li>
<li>I told her I was a sailor that lately came from sea,</li>
<li>and that I belonged to that brigantine that lay anchored in the bay,</li>
<li>and we both sat down together and we chatted for a while,</li>
<li>and I told her many they heard old yarn, which caused her a far too smile,</li>
<li>and for your kind reception I'd have you to understand,</li>
<li>my name is Harry O'Riordan, I am a married man,</li>
<li>and three days before I left the shore my trouble did begin,</li>
<li>for that girl that I so dearly loved belonged to another man,</li>
<li>for when I arose to leave her she gave me this address,</li>
<li>you call in and see my husband, he will treat you to the best,</li>
<li>and I was kindly introduced to a noble looking man, who kindly saluted me and took me by the hand,</li>
<li>and the wine was on the table, and the dinner was at her posthum,</li>
<li>and we all sat down together, and there we go the old afternoon.</li>
