<li>He says your true lover will no more sail they salty</li>
<li>Why before this time tomorrow night, it's what sure I'll be</li>
<li>And then this young damsel</li>
<li>Come over here</li>

<li>She says to herself</li>
<li>If I could see my dear it is quickly I'd warn him</li>

<li>Sailors complete and when she was well-dressed from the head</li>
<li>Well pumps on her feet and a cane in her hand</li>
<li>She met lovely Willie down on the sea strand. Oh</li>

<li>And a straight way to talkie, I would have you prepare</li>
<li>And in 48 hours, I will meet you there</li>
<li>He kissed her red lips. They still didn't her eyes. Oh</li>
<li>Willie I'll save you or else I will die</li>
<li>Great way then she gave them a handful of clothes</li>
<li>And she walked up the strand like a young sailor boat</li>
<li>She met her old father up on the sea strand</li>
<li>And he took her for Willie</li>
<li>Saying you are the man</li>
<li>A sword from his side a</li>
<li>Median flakey through and a beautiful body</li>
<li>And when he had found out what he had done</li>
<li>Ringing up his hands and the tearing up there. Oh</li>
<li>My dear my dear water this I have</li>
<li>I've killed a flower of old England</li>
<li>Fairland town</li>
<li>Then up on his feet</li>
<li>Big start and he knelt on his door till it pierced his heart</li>
