<li>A.F.S. recording, number 2342, side B.</li>
<li>The picture on the bar room floor.</li>
<li>I'll paint you a fine wood drum cellar, I'll hang it over you.</li>
<li>It was a balmy summer evening, when a goodly crowd was here,</li>
<li>with twelve night stills by the room on the corner of the first floor.</li>
<li>As songs and witty sayings came through that open door,</li>
<li>a vagabond crept slowly in and paused upon the floor.</li>
<li>Where did he come from? someone cried.</li>
<li>The wind has blown him in.</li>
<li>What does he want? another cried, some witty rum or gin.</li>
<li>Here, Toby, stick him, if you're equal to the works.</li>
<li>He's as filthy as a turk, I wouldn't know.</li>
<li>It was a balmy summer evening, and a goodly crowd was here,</li>
<li>with twelve night stills by the room on the corner of the square.</li>
<li>As songs and witty sayings came through that open door,</li>
<li>a vagabond crept slowly in and paused upon the floor.</li>
<li>Where did he come from? someone cried.</li>
<li>The wind has blown him in.</li>
<li>What does he want? another cried, some witty rum or gin.</li>
<li>Here, Toby, stick him, if you're equal to the works.</li>
<li>I wouldn't touch him with a fork.</li>
<li>He's as filthy as a turk.</li>
<li>Those bandages this poor wretch took in social good grace,</li>
<li>and smiled as though he thought he'd struck the proper place.</li>
<li>Come, boys, and know that kindly hearts among a good crowd.</li>
<li>To be in such good company would make a deacon proud.</li>
<li>Give me a drink, that's what I want.</li>
<li>I'm out of fun, you know.</li>
<li>When I had tax to treat the gang, this hand was never slow.</li>
<li>Oh, you laugh as though you thought this pocket never held a sue.</li>
<li>But I was fixed at times, boys, as well as any one of you.</li>
<li>Uh-oh, there it sank.</li>
<li>Five fingers and quark and whiskey, too.</li>
<li>Here's luck, boys, and landlord, my best regards to you.</li>
<li>You've treated me kindly, and I'd like to tell you how I came to be</li>
<li>this dirty thot you see before you know.</li>
<li>As I said before, I was a man with muscles, frame, and health.</li>
<li>But for one blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth.</li>
<li>I was a painter, not one that daubed on bricks and wood,</li>
<li>but an artist, and for my age was raised pretty good.</li>
<li>I worked hard at my canvas in bidding for it to rise,</li>
<li>for gradually I saw the star of fame before my eyes.</li>
<li>I made a picture, perhaps you've seen.</li>
<li>It was called The Case of Fame, which brought me 1,500 pounds</li>
<li>and added to my name.</li>
<li>Then came a woman, now comes the funny part,</li>
<li>with eyes that petrified my brain and sunk into my heart.</li>
<li>Boys, did you ever see a girl for whom your soul rebuked?</li>
<li>With a heart like the millivine used to be that was blue,</li>
<li>and eyes of the sea to gorken o'er a reef of chestnut hair.</li>
<li>If so could she, for there never was another half so fair.</li>
<li>I was working on a portrait one afternoon in May</li>
<li>of a fair-haired boy of friend of mine who lived across the way.</li>
<li>And Madeleine admired it, and much to my surprise,</li>
<li>she said she'd like to know that lad that had such dreamy eyes.</li>
<li>Well, it didn't take long to know him.</li>
<li>And before that month had flown, that lad had stolen my darling,</li>
<li>and I was left alone.</li>
<li>And there one year of misery had passed about my head.</li>
<li>The one I loved had tarnished and was dead.</li>
<li>But then I took to Big Boy.</li>
<li>Why, I never see a smile I thought</li>
<li>could be amusing laughing all the while.</li>
<li>Come, friend, there's a teardrop in your eye.</li>
<li>Laugh like me.</li>
<li>It's only big women that should cry.</li>
<li>Give to me the chocolate.</li>
<li>Put to mark, put to mark, put to mark.</li>
