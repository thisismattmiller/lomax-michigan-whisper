<li>2263, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>He was a good one. He composed quite a few minutes, but I never learned how to get it from him so I heard him sing a couple of times.</li>
<li>What other one did he compose? Well, I can't really remember. He got downed the last time he went off stage. He was caught in a boat and the boat went down and he got downed.</li>
<li>Was he an Irishman too? Well, I don't. I think a legal Irishman in there. I don't know what his brother, his mother's brother was a pioneer in.</li>
<li>He was on this lot around here in Mount Pleasant. Did he cook? Well, he didn't cook in Mount Pleasant. He lived on the rest of here a while and then he cooked in that restaurant.</li>
<li>And then he used to give a job in the lumber wood and he'd go and cook. He'd cook on the drive once a year. He'd cook on the river. And then he'd cook two seats on time in the can.</li>
<li>Oh my, cracker guy. One of the best. Just a good cook guy everywhere after. Awful good cook. I bet you're right. Yes, you were a good one.</li>
<li>Well, what was this thing about the old Turk? The old what? The old Turk. One man left, you know. I don't understand that.</li>
<li>Well, no, I don't know either. I don't know what he put that in there, but he put that in there. I don't know what he meant about that, but that was his song.</li>
<li>Well, it's about a river man, you know. Fine math and everything, and he ran away with another girl. She lost him out. She was a school teacher. She wanted to marry him and everything like that, you know.</li>
<li>One evening last June as I rambo, the hot green woods and valleys they moaned. They must be those notes were melodious, and so was the whistle willed song.</li>
<li>The frogs in the marshes were coquing. The hot green thorns were whistling for rain. Ed and Patrick, the rummy was drumming on the banks of the Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>The sun in the west was declining, and Patrick's feet on the ground. My weary feet bored me onward, not turning wherever they led.</li>
<li>I happened to see a young school man. He was mourning in a sorrowful strain. He was mourning for a jolly young lastman on the banks of the Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>Saying alas, saying alas, my dear Johnny has left me. I'm afraid I shall see him no more. He had gone on the lower west coast and pleased a pulling of fifty foot oars.</li>
<li>He went off on a trip with the gambo and had left me in sorrow and pain. And 'tis over two months as he started from the banks of the Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>I stepped up beside this young school man, and thus unto her I did say, why is this your mourning so sadly when all things is smiling and gay?</li>
<li>For whom, for whom I so sad become so plain, he has left me alone here to wander on the banks of the Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>Will you please tell me what kind of clothing your jolly young lastman did wear? For I also belong to the river, perhaps that I've seen him somewhere.</li>
<li>If to me you will plainly describe him and tell me your young lastman's name, perhaps I can tell you the reason he not backed from the little Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>His pants were made out of two mule sacks with a patch of footscarf on each knee. His shirt and his jacket were dyed with a bark from a buttered-up tree.</li>
<li>He wore a large open-faced sticker with almost a yard of steel chain when he went away with those gambo from the banks of the Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>He wore a red sack on his middle with a man hanging down by each side. His shoes numbered ten were of cowhide with heels about forty-six wide.</li>
<li>His name, it was Amish Johnny Murphy, and Amish was neither a stain, and he was as jolly a lastman as ever on the Villeau Plains.</li>
<li>He was stout, broad-shouldered, and manly, his height about six-foot-one, his hair in just trying to be sandy, and his whiskers as red as the sun. His age was somewhere about thirty. He neither was foolish nor vain.</li>
<li>The steel of the Wisconsin River was the reason he left the U Plains. Of Johnny Murphy, the name of a lastman, I used to know him quite well, but that is the tale I must tell you.</li>
<li>There Johnny is down in the dell. They bared him near the scuff Norway. You will never behold him again. No stone marks the spot where your lastman sleeps, far from the little old old Plains.</li>
<li>When the school mom had heard his information, he fainted and fell as if dead. I scooped up my hat full of water and poured it on the top of her head.</li>
<li>She opened her eyes and looked wily, like someone was nearly insane, and I was afraid she would perish on the banks of the little old Plains.</li>
<li>My course attended you, Wisconsin, may a rat in your faulty drawer, may Eberlo head and sandbar be as dry as a log, schoolhouse floor. May the willows up on all your islands lie down like a field of bright green, for taking my jolly young lastman away from the little old Plains.</li>
<li>My course lights on you, little gamble, for taking my Johnny away. I hope that the egg you will seed you and shake you down into the Plains. May your lumber go down to the bottom and never rise there.</li>
<li>You had no business of taking Johnny Murphy away from the little old Plains. Now I will desert my vacation. I won't teach the street school anymore, but I will go somewhere I'll ever.</li>
<li>I'll go to some fire-forging country, to England, to France or to Spain, but I'll never forget Johnny Murphy on the banks of the little old Plains.</li>
<li>What was that fifty foot oar she kept talking about?</li>
<li>Yeah, damn it, I made him bark exactly on the edge. Tell him all we're saying now.</li>
