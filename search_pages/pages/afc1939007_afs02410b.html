<li>2401A2 and 2401B were spoiled.</li>
<li>2402-2409 were discarded.</li>
<li>2410A is spoiled. Here's 2410B1 and 2.</li>
<li>It belonged and won't. It belonged to my daddy before I was born.</li>
<li>It hung in the kitchen beyond on an egg.</li>
<li>It's an emblem of labor was that dinner pail.</li>
<li>Oh, it glistened like silver so sparkling and bright.</li>
<li>I'm proud of the trifle at hell gifts we buy.</li>
<li>In summer or winter, in rain, snow or hail,</li>
<li>sure I'd carry that kettle, my dad's dinner pail.</li>
<li>When the day would be rainy, my daddy'd stay home.</li>
<li>He'd polish his kettle as clean as a bone.</li>
<li>He'd joke with me, Mother, but me, he would, Well,</li>
<li>if I just put a finger on Dad's dinner pail.</li>
<li>There's a place for the coffee and also the bread.</li>
<li>The cone beef and pradies and off it was sent.</li>
<li>Go fill it with porter with wine, beer, or ale.</li>
<li>To the drink what tastes sweeter from Dad's dinner pail.</li>
<li>To the Minneapolis Tribune came a little child one day</li>
<li>who asked to see the editor in her own dear childish way.</li>
<li>She was taken to the editor and placed upon his knee.</li>
<li>Now my child tell me your story, just tell it all to me.</li>
<li>My daddy's gone away sir, I'm lonely as can be.</li>
<li>Oh won't you find my daddy, find my daddy here for me.</li>
<li>Everybody reads the Tribune, so the little one then said,</li>
<li>Will you place this in your paper?</li>
<li>It was just an ad with dread.</li>
<li>Wanted my darling Papa to come home right away.</li>
<li>Mama's health is failing, he's thinking day by day.</li>
<li>He dearly loves and forgives you, he's still your darling dude.</li>
<li>Come home to Mama and Mamie when you read tonight's Tribune.</li>
<li>It was way up in Alaska in a mining camp unknown.</li>
<li>There stood a group of miners reading papers from back home.</li>
<li>One was reading all the personals and cried, What can this be?</li>
<li>It's from a girl named Mamie, yes and it is meant for me.</li>
<li>A steamer leaves today boys, I'll make it if I try.</li>
<li>I love my little family, so I'm going home goodbye.</li>
<li>They all gathered round the Tribune and unto each comrade said,</li>
<li>May God bless your dude and Mamie, and he sees the words which read.</li>
<li>Wanted my darling Papa to come home right away.</li>
<li>Mama's health is failing, he's thinking day by day.</li>
<li>He dearly loves and forgives you, he's still your darling dude.</li>
<li>Come home to Mama and Mamie when you read tonight's Tribune.</li>
<li>These two songs, my dad's Winnipelle and the Minneapolis Tribune, were sung by John Happy Jack Woodward of Onondaga, Michigan on October the 4th, 1938. The songs were sung in the back end of Charlie Groot and John Derby.</li>
