<li>No, they started and worked there all winter and put in those throwaways near the things</li>
<li>of this river.</li>
<li>Good banking place, they went up and cleaned, cleared off a good banking place there and</li>
<li>they worked there with a big 125 men all winter and had lots of teams involved in that river</li>
<li>and put in all these work all winter and when they come to break the throwaway in the spring,</li>
<li>well they broke the throwaway and kept breaking the throwaway and had some of the men keeping</li>
<li>the laws going, going a little bit and when they got the throwaways all broke, well then</li>
<li>they decided they'd drive the gold you see, drive these logs out.</li>
<li>Well they started to drive those logs out, they drove two weeks and finally they came</li>
<li>right straight back with the head, the jammers, the head fellas running the head logs.</li>
<li>They drove two weeks and they run onto some camps that look, the head fellas did run onto</li>
<li>some camps there that looked like where they worked all winter, these boys you see and</li>
<li>Paul did too and he said well Paul here's some camps that look, didn't get out, the</li>
<li>camp, put them pretty close to the river you see them, then the camps resembled our camps,</li>
<li>your camps, yes.</li>
<li>Well then they'd go two weeks more, started to get my way around and they came right back</li>
<li>to that same place again, there were these camps again.</li>
<li>Well then they got out and discovered and found out that hell they'd been driving there</li>
<li>for four weeks with 70, 80, 100 men on that drive, paying them good wages and working</li>
<li>like that.</li>
<li>Perry said he was one of the fellas working there, drove there four weeks.</li>
<li>Well Paul said well now we're in an awful state, he said we'll investigate this.</li>
<li>So they went around and around and they couldn't find no inlet and outlet of that lake, it</li>
<li>was a lake, instead of a river it was a lake.</li>
<li>Well then he didn't know what in the world to do, he worked out all winter, spent about</li>
<li>all he had and he didn't know what in the world to do and so he had that winter, that</li>
<li>awful cold winter where he had that blue ox and that blue ox was one of the stoutest animals</li>
<li>that ever was hitched up so he wanted to, he looked all over, he went out to look to see</li>
<li>if he could, he discovered that and he went to look to see if he could get an outlet from</li>
<li>this here.</li>
<li>Well there was a pretty close to half a mile of a canal to dig if he got an outlet to this</li>
<li>place to where he, when he'd get to a river he'd put his log through, you see, to get</li>
<li>that outlet that, well then he could drive his log through there and take him for mills.</li>
<li>So he looked, finally he heard of a big cow, the old one, the biggest, about the biggest</li>
<li>cow in the world, put in there and he went and got her, give $150 for this cow and they</li>
<li>took her up and this cow was giving milk and they, I don't know, they had some kind of</li>
<li>feed to feed her and the milk tasted something like medicine, you know, and everything like</li>
<li>that.</li>
<li>The kind of hay and stuff that he was given and he got something out of the hay and he</li>
<li>ate it and it made the milk taste like medicine.</li>
<li>I'd cut that out but finally they worked this here and his men, his crew went and they took</li>
<li>them and they plowed it and scraped this right out, broke it right out of there, some of</li>
<li>the frost in the ground but they just dropped that right out there in no time at all.</li>
<li>When they got through then they drove their log through and went out on to the river and</li>
<li>then it was all right.</li>
<li>So they had to do that to save what he, or he lost all he had, you see.</li>
<li>Well, this place was an awful place for stones and they dealt all their axes and them days</li>
<li>they didn't have no grindstones and geez, the axes all got dull hitting them on stones.</li>
<li>Well, coming right to this place, it was just when they come to this river where they go</li>
<li>down it's an awful hilly and damn it, they get up on there and they wanted to grind their</li>
<li>axes and they didn't know what in the world to do and Paul says, Well, I'll tell you</li>
<li>boys, there's awful stones here and you get these here, get your axes, hold them right</li>
<li>on here now.</li>
<li>You have to run a little bit, hold them right on here, that this here stone road and follow</li>
<li>them right up and keep your axes on these stones and grind them sharp and sharp.</li>
<li>So they done that and, my God, they set the river on fire and the fellow down below there,</li>
<li>he was going to kill some hogs at that time and he had a hundred hogs down there and damn</li>
<li>it, he didn't have to buy this water, he put them out in the river, soaked them right there</li>
<li>and he scolded all his hogs.</li>
<li>That's what praise, hobby is, you know, something like that gets off the stuff of that.</li>
<li>I can't tell if it's good to pray because you're alive on that kind of stuff.</li>
<li>Well, let's have a song, huh?</li>
<li>Maybe I talk so much I can't sing it.</li>
<li>Oh, no.</li>
<li>I don't think you're that good.</li>
<li>Well, what do you want?</li>
<li>Well, whatever one you feel like singing.</li>
<li>Oh, I don't know.</li>
<li>It doesn't make any difference to me, whatever you say or what you like.</li>
<li>Well, I'll sing it just as I sing it and the other fellows, they'll sing it a little different</li>
<li>and they know it and they've learned it from this same fellow or from somebody else.</li>
<li>I don't know.</li>
<li>I'm not going to bother them asking, but they'll sing it for me.</li>
<li>Well, you say you feel what?</li>
<li>I don't know, it's just all right, eh, I don't have to...</li>
<li>I am loathing lumberjacks, the pine which is my home, like many other fellows, from camp</li>
<li>to camp I've grown, many a raging river boys, I've worked throughout this land, but now I'm</li>
<li>on the man of steel, with a Peavey in my hand, yes on the Muskegon River boys, for many a</li>
<li>dollar I've earned, from Holton to Lake Michigan, East Crook and Bar I've learned, the man of</li>
<li>steel, the butterfield is humble and the grand, but now I'm on the man of steel, with a Peavey</li>
<li>in my hand, on the Muskegon, where is the money that I have earned, not a dollar can I show,</li>
<li>it scatters to the poor winds, while in my wage I go, I could have had my money boys,</li>
<li>no misfortune do I claim, I lay it not to hard times, there's no one but me to blame,</li>
<li>my muscle is my fortune, hard work I do not fear, the money I have earned, should never</li>
<li>go for a beard, so let's save our money boys, until we older grow, we can sest around the</li>
<li>fire and we'll let the storm wind blow, now I'm on the man of steel river, the stream is</li>
<li>great in height, it's fun to see, I jam the blogs as they go rushing by, around the crooks</li>
<li>and turns my boys, together we shall ride, I am the happy pinewood boy, the river is</li>
<li>my pride, now we're on the man of steel lake, as ragged as you please, but how happy is the</li>
<li>man of wealth he's sporting at his ease, our money is already boys, and the grog shops</li>
<li>is open high, but remember what I tell you, that I'm bound to play it by, if there's anyone</li>
<li>that I pity, it is a man that's old and grey, who has to face the storms of winter, for</li>
<li>to earn his brand each day, so while our strength the wasting boys, our money let the storm,</li>
<li>when we are old and people, we'll face the storm no more, for my muscle is my fortune,</li>
<li>hard work I do not fear, the money I am earning, could never go for the years, so let the sailor</li>
<li>money boys, until we older grow, we can set around the fire and we'll let the storm wind</li>
<li>on, that's all.</li>
