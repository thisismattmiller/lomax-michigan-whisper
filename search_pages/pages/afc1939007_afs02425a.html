<li>2411 through 2424 have been discarded.</li>
<li>Here's 2425A.</li>
<li>This is Champion Michelin, Fred Carrier, singing this song.</li>
<li>It's an old song of many years gone by.</li>
<li>It is called The Raffle for a Stove.</li>
<li>Last Thursday I attended the raffle for a stove</li>
<li>to wait on a wife and family at Tim McGarley's Grove.</li>
<li>Hogan and O'Brien, they all come in a drove</li>
<li>to take the dice and shake it nice and try to win the stove.</li>
<li>Forward four and Deleman left while the music stayed in play.</li>
<li>It was a grand delight to see the sight of an Irishman so gay.</li>
<li>I never laughed so hearty in the chorus of my life</li>
<li>to see old Plugg McCarty come a-waltzing with his wife.</li>
<li>At nine o'clock exactly the raffle had begun.</li>
<li>Tom Kelly jumped ten feet high when sixty-four was plung.</li>
<li>Hogan cried out, Murder! with a brick as I was clothed.</li>
<li>And on that night I had to fight with a raffling for a stove.</li>
<li>Forward four and Deleman left while the music stayed in play.</li>
<li>It was a grand delight to see the sight of an Irishman so gay.</li>
<li>I never laughed so hearty in the chorus of my life</li>
<li>to see old Plugg McCarty come a-waltzing with his wife.</li>
<li>At six o'clock this morning the raffle it was o'er.</li>
<li>Tom Kelly, he got saved and drunk and stole away the door.</li>
<li>Hogan with a bottle, he broke it on his nose.</li>
<li>And when he caught him by the throat I surely thought he'd show.</li>
<li>Forward four and Deleman left while the music stayed in play.</li>
<li>It was a grand delight to see the sight of an Irishman so gay.</li>
<li>I never laughed so hearty in the chorus of my life</li>
<li>to see old Plugg McCarty come a-waltzing with his wife.</li>
<li>- When did you learn that, Tom? - When did I learn?</li>
<li>Oh, I learned that when I was nothing but a kid that high.</li>
<li>I didn't check it. I have some old lumberjack.</li>
<li>They come from Kennedy or I don't know where yet come from.</li>
<li>I never had to learn the song when nobody's there.</li>
<li>- Were you born here in Chatham? - I was born here in Chatham.</li>
<li>I was two years in Kennedy.</li>
<li>That's where I learned all my French now, the most of my French.</li>
<li>I learned it all in Chatham.</li>
<li>Then I was up in the cotton country all the way to Chatham.</li>
<li>- And without a French article... - No, Joe Quinamans.</li>
<li>That's an Irishman and he was a brother of English.</li>
<li>- How many years did you work in the woods? - I worked in the woods for 47 years.</li>
<li>- 47 years. - I started at 13 years and I'm 60.</li>
<li>Almost 60.</li>
<li>- Every winter you've been in the woods? - Every winter, excepting a little while.</li>
<li>Sometimes I went in the mine, like I told you.</li>
<li>I went in the mine just to have some experience about mining.</li>
<li>But I worked 47 years in, running on hogging slaves and loading them</li>
<li>around jammers and chains.</li>
<li>- Do you want to go back to the woods? - You bet. I am going right back.</li>
<li>- Why do you like the woods? - Because I feel as though I'm at home.</li>
<li>I got it in for such a practice.</li>
<li>And I worked two men in at the job.</li>
<li>Last winter I hauled there, I was with Negu Northley,</li>
<li>a man six foot tall and 24 years old, weighs 200 pounds.</li>
<li>Then I had my end all the time. I'm 60 and he was 24.</li>
