<li>Oh, a noble lord of the high deep sea, Come passing by on a milk-white sea,</li>
<li>Good morning to thee, my pretty fair maid, Twice good morning, kind sir, do you say,</li>
<li>Since are you milkin' teary-eyed, Oh, no, you're sleep-by-sleep, love-by-jove.</li>
<li>Oh, a noble lord of the high deep sea, Come passing by on a milk-white sea,</li>
<li>Since are you milkin' teary-eyed, Oh, no, you're sleep-by-sleep, love-by-jove.</li>
<li>And he jumps off his milk-white steed, Spurting at this weather, oh, no,</li>
<li>Oh, a noble lord of the high deep sea, Come passing by on a milk-white sea,</li>
<li>He rode the oak till he came to Jones, Where she sat a-milking all alone,</li>
<li>Good morning to thee, my pretty fair maid, Twice good morning, kind sir, do you say,</li>
<li>Since are you milkin' teary-eyed, Oh, no, you're sleep-by-sleep, love-by-jove.</li>
<li>Then he pulls out his purse of gold, As much as his two hands could hold,</li>
<li>All this he done to reflect his Jones, As she sat a-milking all alone.</li>
<li>Then he pulls out his purse of gold, As much as his two hands could hold,</li>
<li>All this I'll give for your maiden's head, And her two cheeks blushed like the rosy red.</li>
<li>Oh, goddammit.</li>
<li>A weaver lived in our town, The major's wife loved dearly,</li>
<li>He courted her both night and day, Gained her favor sirely,</li>
<li>One day this weaver's gone to town, As they supposed a-drinking,</li>
<li>When the major he came to singin', With his oak in his king,</li>
<li>All the weavers he came home that night, Which put them in a fright, sir,</li>
<li>For they had both got into bed, As they supposed for the night, sir,</li>
<li>For the weaver's wife gave him to know, It was a bold adventure,</li>
<li>For they had both got into bed, As they supposed for the night, sir,</li>
<li>For the weaver's wife gave him to know, It was a bold adventure,</li>
<li>First come to the bed, sir, You must go, to let my husband tender,</li>
<li>Oh, weaver he jumped into bed, And he crowned his wife with kisses,</li>
<li>Oh, dear Susie, you must go, Oh, dear Susie, you must go,</li>
<li>And his wife with kisses, Oh, dear Susie, what could I have,</li>
<li>If I could have my wages, Oh, it's wasteful what you want, my dear,</li>
<li>And I will stop your loaning, If it's a bottle of wine from number nine,</li>
<li>You'll have it here by morning, Right to the loo, the loo, the loo,</li>
<li>Right to ye, don't I know, If it's a bottle of wine from number nine,</li>
<li>You'll have it here by morning, Oh, the weaver he jumped out of bed,</li>
<li>For the gift of wine in haste, And when the maid's biches he slipped on,</li>
<li>Which was a sad mistake, sir, Right to the loo, the loo, the loo,</li>
<li>Right to ye, don't I know, When the maid's biches he slipped on,</li>
<li>Which was a sad mistake, sir, Oh, the weaver he went home next morning,</li>
<li>Bites, but her chest, Oh, dear, she puts his hand into his purse,</li>
<li>To see if gold was plenty, He digs his biches into the balloons,</li>
<li>And gives me more than twenty, Right to the loo, the loo, the loo,</li>
<li>Right to ye, don't I know, He digs his biches into the balloons,</li>
<li>And gives me more than twenty, Oh, the weaver he went home next morning,</li>
<li>Wipes a bed of shilling, That just left with the maid your all night</li>
<li>long, I swear that I was willing, For you know he always wears fine clothes,</li>
<li>And I will lay a wager, That his biches fit me full as well as you,</li>
<li>You fit the maid your right to the loo, the loo, the loo,</li>
<li>Right to ye, don't I know, That his biches fit me full as well as you,</li>
<li>You fit the maid your, Oh, it's wife, oh, wife, and I don't give</li>
<li>a damn how we maintain our riches, You may sleep with the maid your every night,</li>
<li>But I swear I'll see his biches.</li>
