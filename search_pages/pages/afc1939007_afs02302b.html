<li>2302 B1 and 2. A boss from Roanoke, Tennessee, bopped out and said, So Pat began pouring it on the cow's head, making the sign at the cross as he poured it all in a sudden, the cow left the road.</li>
<li>They laughed at these others with faces so blue, thinking that she here is a Protestant crow.</li>
<li>Says Pat there must be something wrong in her, or isn't the Protestant strong with her.</li>
<li>Marsha, may he the diva go along with her. Pat, she's a Protestant cow.</li>
<li>Would you go ahead and say his name on my behalf, because this was done by Barney.</li>
<li>Barney Martin.</li>
<li>What's your name?</li>
<li>Barney J. Martin.</li>
<li>How old are you?</li>
<li>May I? I was 71 years old on the 13th of last July.</li>
<li>And how long have you lived on this island?</li>
<li>I was born and raised here.</li>
<li>Where did you learn the song?</li>
<li>Oh, from some fellow around town.</li>
<li>How long ago?</li>
<li>Oh, God, it must have been 20 years ago.</li>
<li>An old woman went out to the barn, some eggs for her to hunt, and when she took to pick them up, the mouse ran up her tongue, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>She ran to the barn door, she hollered loud and thrilled, she hollered to her husband who was working at the mill, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>Her husband came running as fast as he could fly, saying, 'Wife, my dearest wife, oh, I thought I heard you cry, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>Now I have a mouse way up in my tongue, and if he is not turned around, I fear he'll gnaw his way out, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>He put his arms around her waist, he laid her on the floor, and every time he missed that mouse by an inch and a half or more, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>He ran to the barn door, he hollered loud and thrilled, he hollered to the hired man who was working at the hill, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>My wife had the hired man came running as fast as he could fly, saying, 'Master, dearest master, oh, I thought I heard you cry, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>My wife has a mouse way up in her tongue, and if he is not turned around, I fear he'll gnaw his way out, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>He put his arms around his waist, he laid her on the ground, and every time he took a jab, he turned that mouse around, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>Now just to show you our husband was deceived, for when she got all the food she wanted, the mouse ran out of her sleeve, saying, 'Achidurrayen, rayen, rayen, chinkidurrayen, raye.'</li>
<li>Where'd you learn that? Well, I don't know where I learned it, a lumber camp someplace.</li>
<li>[Silence]</li>
