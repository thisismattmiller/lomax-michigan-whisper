<li>A.F.S. recording number 2348, side B.</li>
<li>The black-and-brown horse wants to jump into the stable.</li>
<li>Young, young, he says, the black-and-brown horse wants to jump into the stable.</li>
<li>My darling has given me a home, I must march.</li>
<li>I haven't given it to you, you took it yourself.</li>
<li>If you travel to a foreign land, you will come back.</li>
<li>And if the stranger comes, he will think of going home.</li>
<li>He swings his tail, he swings his tail, he will think of going home.</li>
<li>And if he comes back home, he will find his darling in the stable.</li>
<li>He swings his tail, he swings his tail, he will think of going home.</li>
<li>It's all right, it's all right.</li>
<li>She reaches out with her snow-white hand and cries, Yes, please, I am crying.</li>
<li>Don't cry, don't cry, my dear child, you should never cry.</li>
<li>There is nothing more beautiful in this world and nowhere else in the world.</li>
