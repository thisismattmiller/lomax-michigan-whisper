<li>2296 B1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>And from the river pool across the Atlantic, our good ship was sailing the deep.</li>
<li>The sky bright with sunshine above us and beneath us, the waters asleep.</li>
<li>Not a bad-hearted man was among us, or a jollier crew than first sailed.</li>
<li>Except that first mate had been also a savage, but goes to sea man as ever was ailed.</li>
<li>Regulations and orders his motto, strong as iron and steady and equate,</li>
<li>with a pair of those of bushy black eyebrows and eyes black as those of old naked.</li>
<li>He came up from below one bright morning grasping a youth by the arm.</li>
<li>A poor little raggedy archer who should have been home with his arm.</li>
<li>And he said, And of I, straight and curly, now why are you going away,</li>
<li>cheating the owners and masters, eating and sailing, and all without a...</li>
<li>And the boy with the light bright and winning and laughing the light like a girl,</li>
<li>looked up at that scowling first mate lad and shot back his wrong yellow car.</li>
<li>And he said to the maid very neatly, My stepmother put me on board,</li>
<li>and she sent me a way down below that first to keep me she could not afford.</li>
<li>And she said that this big ship will take me to Halifax town oh so far.</li>
<li>And she said, Oh my lord is your father and your home where the moose angels are.</li>
<li>It was on the sixth of April as I lay on my head,</li>
<li>and thinking of the sorrows that surround my aching head.</li>
<li>And surrounded I was my officers, and with them I was forced far to go,</li>
<li>far to serve a long and dreary trip to the jails of Buffalo.</li>
<li>When I've done my task and got pardoned and once more I am free,</li>
<li>and I went down to send a sea my crew out for to sea.</li>
<li>But perhaps my bye she will give me the bounce when she does come to know</li>
<li>that I led a gang of smugglers to the jails of Buffalo.</li>
<li>Oh this girl she came from Patterson, they true to you I will tell,</li>
<li>she was an only daughter and her parents loved her well.</li>
<li>They brought her up in the fear of the Lord, but little did she know</li>
<li>that she was married to a smuggler who served time in Buffalo.</li>
<li>Oh damn it I am.</li>
<li>Well I guess it's over.</li>
<li>When I've done my task and got pardoned and once more I am free,</li>
<li>and I went down to send a sea my crew out for to sea.</li>
<li>I guess it's on now.</li>
<li>Well then forget about it.</li>
<li>I'm afraid not.</li>
<li>Come around you black stripper and give us no talent.</li>
<li>We'll keep you as warm as any man's towel.</li>
<li>They drop off for a milky blue to make the house ring.</li>
<li>They just make the old hag to make harder to sing.</li>
<li>Come around you black stripper and give us no talent.</li>
