<li>AFS recording number two, three, three, two, side B. Strips one and two.</li>
<li>Our country, our country was invaded and called for volunteers.</li>
<li>Upstaked my loving sister, and her eyes were silver tears.</li>
<li>Go, go, my dearest brother, drive those raiders from our shores.</li>
<li>Oh, I know I need your assistance, but your country needs you more.</li>
<li>Just so I love my country, I gave to it my all.</li>
<li>And if it wasn't for my sister, boys, I'd be content to fall.</li>
<li>Last night my poor old mother made the church as she does lie.</li>
<li>It has been many long weary years, and her spirit went to God.</li>
<li>Likewise, my poor old father bleeds in the deep blue sea.</li>
<li>There was no one left to greet us, just only Nell and me.</li>
<li>Come now, you, come now, you, way 'round me.</li>
<li>Come listen to what I, to my dying prayers.</li>
<li>The past away, way out in northwest Texas, that's but all home of mine.</li>
<li>I know she'll wait my coming to that dear old cabin door.</li>
<li>Come now, way 'round me, now listen to my dying prayers.</li>
<li>We will be to her a brother, and with a brother's care.</li>
<li>We will be to her a brother, of a answered one and all.</li>
<li>We'll protect your darling sister, we'll protect her with our care.</li>
<li>Then one smile of gladness, for the ranger's face was red.</li>
<li>And then one convulsed judder, and the ranger boy was dead.</li>
<li>Far from his loving sister, they'd laid him there to rest, with his saddle for a pillow, and his rifle crossed his breast.</li>
<li>The dying ranger was just done by Captain Asa Two-Blood, September the 10th, 1938, in Charles, Michigan, near St. Ignace.</li>
<li>The notes now to be blown on the violin, tuna, are D and G.</li>
<li>Now E and A.</li>
<li>Stoke the fist was the man, wore his heart in his sleeve, no matter what people would say.</li>
<li>He'd done all his deeds, both good and the bad, on the broad open light of the day.</li>
<li>Chicago's great fire showed the world of James Fisk, the starving to death slow but sure.</li>
<li>A lightning express, mandated by noble James Fisk, through to feed all the hungry and poor.</li>
<li>Now if this thing goes on this way, we'll stand it no more, all the people will rise up in bans.</li>
<li>And the village committee will rise on our shore, we'll take the law in our own hands.</li>
<li>Well, this happened by Stokes was a very rich man, see, rich man's son.</li>
<li>And he was in love with Josephine Manfield, the champion singer of the world.</li>
<li>And Fisk happened around, he met Josephine Manfield, and she got in love with Fisk.</li>
<li>So she left, she quit Stokes and was to marry Fisk.</li>
<li>And Fisk, then Stokes got jealous, see, and of course he shot Fisk, see.</li>
<li>And what did this have to do with the Chicago fire?</li>
<li>Well, you know, Chicago, he was a great magnet, he was a railroad magnet, Fisk was, see, you know what I mean.</li>
<li>And when he heard of this fire and he heard of the people starving to death, he furnished,</li>
<li>he loaded the train with all kinds of provisions, clothing and everything, and money, and he went there with it.</li>
<li>He managed the train himself and went into Chicago and fed all the hungry and poor and clothed them.</li>
<li>And furnished them with money, see, to get along with it, to build up their houses.</li>
<li>And then Stokes shot him, you see, and by Fisk doing such a good deed to Chicago at that time,</li>
