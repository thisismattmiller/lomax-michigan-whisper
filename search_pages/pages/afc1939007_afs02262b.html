<li>Come all you two, one shanty boys with high feet,</li>
<li>Where every ye may be,</li>
<li>Come shanty and the deacon seat,</li>
<li>And listen unto me.</li>
<li>I'll sing the song of Gary's rocks,</li>
<li>And I hear though you should know,</li>
<li>The bravest of all shanty boys,</li>
<li>Is our foreman, young Monroe.</li>
<li>It began one Sunday's morning,</li>
<li>Early daylight did appear,</li>
<li>Our logs were piling mountains high,</li>
<li>We could not keep them clear.</li>
<li>Cheer up, cheer up my river men,</li>
<li>Revolve your heart of woe,</li>
<li>We'll break the dam on Gary's rocks,</li>
<li>Cries our foreman, young Monroe.</li>
<li>Some of those boys were willing,</li>
<li>While others they hid from sight,</li>
<li>For to break a dam on Sunday,</li>
<li>They did not think it was right,</li>
<li>When six of our Canadian boys</li>
<li>Did bother here to go,</li>
<li>And break the dam on Gary's rocks,</li>
<li>With her tool of young Monroe.</li>
<li>They had not picked off many logs,</li>
<li>And all to them did say,</li>
<li>I must send you back up the drive,</li>
<li>My boys, for the dam will soon give away.</li>
<li>Alone he freed the keel of bed,</li>
<li>And when the dam did go,</li>
<li>It carried away on the piling flood,</li>
<li>Our foreman, young Monroe.</li>
<li>When the rest of the boys up at the camp,</li>
<li>The sad news came to hear,</li>
<li>In search of his dead body,</li>
<li>Down the river they did steer,</li>
<li>When there they found to their surprise,</li>
<li>Their sorrow, grief and woe,</li>
<li>All bruised and mangled on the beach,</li>
<li>Laid the corpse of young Monroe.</li>
<li>They picked him up most tenderly,</li>
<li>Smoothed down his waving hair,</li>
<li>There was one perform among them,</li>
<li>Whose cry did raise the air,</li>
<li>The fairest last of second,</li>
<li>All the tears of angry flow,</li>
<li>But her mourns and cries,</li>
<li>Could not awake her true love,</li>
<li>Young Monroe.</li>
<li>The missus packed a whip,</li>
<li>Only by the riverside,</li>
<li>It was her only daughter,</li>
<li>Monroe's intended bride.</li>
<li>The wait did offer tearless love,</li>
<li>The boss to her did pay,</li>
<li>And a gift of gold was sent to her,</li>
<li>By these shanty boys next day.</li>
<li>When she received the money,</li>
<li>She thanked them dearly,</li>
<li>But it was not her portion,</li>
<li>Long on earth would it be,</li>
<li>For it was just six weeks or so,</li>
<li>When she was called to go,</li>
<li>And the shanty boys laid her to rest,</li>
<li>By her true love, young Monroe.</li>
<li>They buried her quite decent,</li>
<li>Like it was at the fourth of May.</li>
<li>Come all you true-born shanty boys,</li>
<li>And for your comrade pray,</li>
<li>Engraved upon a hemlock tree,</li>
<li>Whereby the missus grow,</li>
<li>Is the name and date,</li>
<li>Of the mournful face,</li>
<li>Of our shanty boy Monroe.</li>
