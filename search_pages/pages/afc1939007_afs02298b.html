<li>- 2298 B1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>Sad and gloomy was the morning that a bird was ordered out to die.</li>
<li>Farewell forever, your friends are home, you see no more, for your mournful hearts were</li>
<li>buried on Lake Erie's distant shore.</li>
<li>On all young men and maidens I hope you will attend, and listen to those two verses that</li>
<li>I have lately penned concerning the hardships that I did undergo.</li>
<li>For a comely young lassie called Sally Munroe, oh, for six long weeks are better, no word</li>
<li>did I hear from that comely young lass that I once loved so dear, until one Monday morning</li>
<li>down in a shady grove, oh, did I spy but young Sally Munroe.</li>
<li>On all young men and maidens, concerning the hardships that I did undergo, for a comely</li>
<li>young lassie called Sally Munroe, oh, for lassie a lassie, and I tendered with a young man that</li>
<li>I thought he was my friend, but instead of being a friend, he proved to be a foamy friend,</li>
<li>but instead of being a friend, he'd be friend.</li>
<li>For a comely young lassie called Sally Munroe, oh, dear is my heart love, and here is my hand.</li>
<li>And along the, and along the way next morning we did go, and there I got married to Sally</li>
<li>Munroe.</li>
<li>So, you all right?</li>
