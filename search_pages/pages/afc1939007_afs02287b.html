<li>2287, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>When they came to Phoenix Town, they people did all share.</li>
<li>To see those recruit soldiers, they looked so gay and fair.</li>
<li>And the people all admired her as she marched on parade.</li>
<li>And they thought that a soldier's coat concealed so their image.</li>
<li>And when they came to India Shore, their troubles did begin.</li>
<li>No tongue can tell the hardship that poor Mary was forced to stand.</li>
<li>And when she found her strength was gone, her grief she tried to hide.</li>
<li>She would look around with a joyful smile and find Henry by her side.</li>
<li>And when the battle was raging hot and a bayonet pierced his breast,</li>
<li>he never yielded to the fall, but where he fell, he died.</li>
<li>She raised him from the bloody spot, closed in her arms and pressed.</li>
<li>She duped the healing beating wound when a bullet passed through her breast.</li>
<li>Oh, Mary, lovely Mary, young Henry did say,</li>
<li>I'm afraid you're severely wounded. Love, your face is like the clay.</li>
<li>Since ever I did first know thee, you're the girl I did adore.</li>
<li>And the closer I is not more to rise on India's burning shores.</li>
<li>Oh, by perversion, we've all met together, and I tell you it from Waterford.</li>
<li>Ever I came, far across the wide ocean, in dark gloomy weather.</li>
<li>My heart, it was alike, and my pocket the same.</li>
<li>Sad for leaving old Ireland, but once more on dry land.</li>
<li>By the wayside, a cavern, I happened to spy.</li>
<li>Although I was melting, in my pockets I felt him.</li>
<li>At the price of a drink, I was markedly dry.</li>
<li>Through the cavern, I strolled, the master was droll.</li>
<li>Good morrow to thee, said I, if you please, will you get me a bed?</li>
<li>First, provide me some bread, a bottle of a porter, and a small bit of tea.</li>
<li>Far times they are queer, and provisions are dear.</li>
<li>If you haven't got the meat, I would cheese be content.</li>
<li>To the master, you're right, so he brought me the bike, and I rolled up my cup, and I went.</li>
<li>And my bread and cheese ended, I then condescended to seek some repose, so I asked for a light.</li>
<li>And soon in a dose, I was under the clothes, I popped in my toes, and I blew out the light.</li>
<li>And awake and from sleep, and I heard something scratching.</li>
<li>Commanding and wandering around my bedpost, squeaking and scratching things, I did my watching, and upon my conscience, you've got mighty long cause for a gose.</li>
<li>My breath I suspended, and the night that soon ended, I ventured to peep from beneath the bedpost.</li>
<li>Kneel a murder, what is that? It was a thumping jack rat, wet as it's on the floor at the top of my nose.</li>
<li>Oh curse you said I, you scheming old bag of bones, I'll take that and that as I lift from the floor.</li>
<li>Shouting murder and fire, Tom Jerry Mariah, the rats, they are eating me up like the store.</li>
<li>The master, he got frightened, and he came with a light in, I am murdered alive.</li>
<li>And so must go away, said he before going, I would have you be known for your suffer and bed you five shillings to pay.</li>
<li>Five shillings for what? Oh don't be disgraced then, yourself are a roaster, said I if you please. If I can't flee from rats, you've got to raise an old teacon to charge me five shillings for plain bread and cheese.</li>
<li>Oh perish those rats, I wish they would leave me, they have ruined my trade and I am not worth a rat.</li>
<li>Said I would you those here five shillings, forgive me if I would show you the way to keep out them rats.</li>
<li>Then agreed and said he, said I to, said I to, said I to suffer and bite them and plain bread and cheese.</li>
<li>Said before them, be sure don't you mind up there with eggs, but charge them five shillings, and bad luck to the rats.</li>
