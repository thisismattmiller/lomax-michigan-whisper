<li>AFS recording number two, three, two, eight, side B.</li>
<li>And we were chased by many a ship, both liners and frigates, too. And many a Spanish man</li>
<li>who ordered us try to subdue. But all along that turn of hours, there was cannons roared so loud.</li>
<li>It was all in vain down on the mains to chase the flying clouds. At length the Spanish man</li>
<li>awars, the dungeon hold in view. And she fired a shot across our bow, a signal to be due. Oh, we did</li>
<li>not seem to mind her, but we sped before the wind. When a chain shot broke, our mizzen must, and then</li>
<li>we fell behind. Oh, we cleared our deck for action as the dungeon rained alongside. And all along her</li>
<li>quarter rail was a flowing crimson tide. We fought till Captain Moore was killed and eighty of his men.</li>
<li>When a bomb shell stopped our ship on fire, we were forced to surrender then. And then, next to new</li>
<li>gates, I was bound down in iron chains for the robbing of good merchant ships down on that Spanish</li>
<li>mains. It was liquor and bad company that made a wreck of me. Now you beware of my sad fate and a</li>
<li>card on pirate's face. Well, yes, I can. His name was Johnny Miller. He was an engineer on a steamboat.</li>
<li>When was that? That happened in 1888. Was he a steamboat sailor? He was just a sailor, you know,</li>
<li>before, but he was a steamboat and he learned to be an engineer. Did he write the words down? No,</li>
<li>he never wrote the words down, but he sung it a couple of times and I learned it. Is it a true song?</li>
<li>Well, it must be true, because they'd done that work in those days, you know. It's supposed to be a</li>
<li>true song. It's got to be a true song. They'd done that in those days. How did we get these niggers</li>
<li>over here? Well, they'd brought them over. No, I don't think it was. I don't know why it would be.</li>
<li>They had to have them in QB, you see, for their cotton fields and rice and coffee fields there.</li>
<li>They were slaves when they brought them there, you know. They'd bought and sold and then they began to</li>
<li>buy them over in our country, you see, over in America, in southern part of America, and they</li>
<li>planted them all through the southern states. What do you think of Negroes? Well, I ain't got nothing to</li>
<li>get a Negro. They were brought here. They were caught in their fault. They were captured and</li>
<li>brought here. I don't think there's anything that ought to be wrong about that. If he was brought here and</li>
<li>if he was taken here from here to Germany and landed there and couldn't get away, well, they can't blame you, can they?</li>
