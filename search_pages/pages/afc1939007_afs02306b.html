<li>23.06 B1 and 2.</li>
<li>Now finding her constant, I pulled out a glove, which in parting she gave me as a token of love.</li>
<li>She hung on my breast while the tears they did flow, saying, You are my Donald, return to Glencoe.</li>
<li>Cheer up, my dear Florey, your sorrows are o'er. While life does remain, we will never part more.</li>
<li>Though the storms of war at a distance may blow, in peace and contentment we reside at Glencoe.</li>
<li>What's your name again? Lewis Bridep. Lewis Bridep. And who did you learn the song from?</li>
<li>Well now, I tell you, I see in the paper they had some songs advertised, and they sent me that, and I learnt it right off from that paper.</li>
<li>How long ago? Well 20 years, 20 years ago. Why did you get the tune to it?</li>
<li>Well I just figured it out all by myself, and here's a quote.</li>
<li>She worked for my mother, and I heard her sing that several times, and then she wrote it off for me.</li>
<li>And I learnt it off from that paper, and I was 17 then, I know that, I was 17.</li>
<li>She must have been pretty beside. Well, fairly good, yeah.</li>
<li>Come, all ye fearless highwaymen, and outlaws of disdain, who'd scorn to work in slavery and wear the ball and chain.</li>
<li>Pay attention, pay to what I say, and bear thee this in view, and I'll soon relate the fearless fate of Bo Jack Donahoe.</li>
<li>This boatman, a daunted highwayman, he had companions for.</li>
<li>There was Mike Claymores and Underwood, Webber and Winslow too.</li>
<li>Those were the four SOC gates of Bo Jack Donahoe.</li>
<li>The kings and nobles were afraid to travel by night or day, for fear of meeting Donahoe while on the king's highway.</li>
<li>For every week the newspaper would publish something new about this fearless highwayman they called Jack Donahoe.</li>
<li>As he and his companions rode out one afternoon, little thinking that the fangs of death would meet them here so soon.</li>
<li>But to their surprise the bush police did quickly come in view, and in a short time they did advance and fire on Donahoe.</li>
<li>Said he, Now, boys, if you prove to, I will record your fame, so people cannot look on us in scorn and disdain,</li>
<li>for to hang upon the gallows I never intend to do, for this day I'll fight until I die, cried Bo Jack Donahoe.</li>
<li>Oh, no, cried Wards Cardley once, Leo, no, that never can be.</li>
<li>There are over two hundred people and only five of we, and if we wait we'll be too late.</li>
<li>The battle we shall rule, begun from Leo Cardley, dog cried Bo Jack, dog cried Bo Jack.</li>
