<li>Boy, it ain't no need to try to tell me nothing.</li>
<li>You can't tell me nothing about the cycle because, not late on your cycle,</li>
<li>'cause I work for every contractor up and down the line.</li>
<li>And I know just exactly what they'll do and how they will see.</li>
<li>That's why you hear me say it. I ain't no stranger. You can't tell me nothing.</li>
<li>I've been down there lots of times.</li>
<li>I worked on the living a long time ago.</li>
<li>It ain't nothing 'bout the living camp, boy, that I don't know.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Said I ain't no stranger. I've been down in the cycle before.</li>
<li>Now there ain't but one contractor. It's very bad, I feel.</li>
<li>You're pulling George Mill and they don't line back here.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Said I ain't no stranger. I've been down in the cycle before.</li>
<li>Now there's Mr. Forrest Jones. He ain't so long and tall.</li>
<li>He killed a mercy man and he loved to kill us all.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Said I ain't no stranger. I've been down in the cycle before.</li>
<li>Play it one time, play it.</li>
<li>[Music]</li>
<li>Now Mr. Charlie Loran is a mercy man.</li>
<li>The best contractor, pardon me, lives up and down the line.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Well I ain't no stranger. I've been down in the cycle before.</li>
<li>Now when you leave out to Keltner on Highway 44,</li>
<li>the first camp you get to, it is called Rainy Mow.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Said I ain't no stranger. I've been down in the cycle before.</li>
<li>I ain't gonna kiss on. I ain't gonna break down.</li>
<li>Breaking down, we'll get a man all down in his bag.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Said I ain't no stranger. I've been down in the cycle before.</li>
<li>I have a friend in Arkansas. Tell me what to do.</li>
<li>I told him to come to Arkansas. I told him no, no, no.</li>
<li>Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me. Don't you think I know?</li>
<li>Said I ain't no stranger. I've been down in Arkansas before.</li>
<li>Breaking down, we'll get a man all down in his bag.</li>
<li>The Loran brothers are seven, the company of them, each seven brothers.</li>
<li>One Charlie Loran, Los Loran, Eddie Loran, Clarence Loran, and Blair Loran, Ike Loran, Levy Contra.</li>
<li>All throughout the state of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia.</li>
<li>He has given pretty tough names. Charlie has given pretty tough names. Charlie has given pretty tough names. Charlie has given pretty tough names.</li>
<li>Charlie Loran is the best of all. He owns a farm in Gladys, Arkansas.</li>
<li>He's the man that pleaded for the labor, when they were so cruel to the men going to Levy.</li>
<li>Then there was a time when Pick Owl's stem was walking its beat.</li>
<li>(static buzzing)</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
