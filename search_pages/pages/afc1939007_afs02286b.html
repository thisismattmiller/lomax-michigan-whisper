<li>- 22-86B, one and two.</li>
<li>Begin to load and fire as fast as he was able</li>
<li>And every shot he struck this spot was right below my navel</li>
<li>Gone again to Raya, gone again to Raya</li>
<li>Tommy's prick is short and thick and the skin on it is yellow</li>
<li>And the stuff comes out of it looks like white bees wax and paddle-o</li>
<li>Gone again to Raya, gone again to Raya</li>
<li>- From an old fellow about 80 years of age called Jack Evans.</li>
<li>He was a lumberjack all his life</li>
<li>and he was located up at the lighthouse on a homestead.</li>
<li>Oh, he had several awful songs</li>
<li>and he had a lot of goddamn Good Night Soul songs too</li>
<li>and he was a good singer.</li>
<li>(clears throat)</li>
<li>Oh, my father dressed me in the bricks</li>
<li>And there's a costume</li>
<li>And oh, what they were, did he owe</li>
<li>And he sent me to get the mirror shot</li>
<li>To Robin Thompson's smidio</li>
<li>Smitty lies beyond the bridge surrounded by the lawn, oh</li>
<li>And every time I went away the girls were to the laughing</li>
<li>Let me fall badoo a day, let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>And fall badoo a day, let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>Oh, what do you think of my employee</li>
<li>While the mirror she was eschewing, oh</li>
<li>I slept in behind her hand</li>
<li>No top, oh, hell I could</li>
<li>My father dressed me in a brick</li>
<li>And oh, what they were, did he owe</li>
<li>And he sent me to get the mirror shot</li>
<li>To Robin Thompson's smidio</li>
<li>Smitty lies beyond the bridge surrounded by the lawn, oh</li>
<li>And every time I went away the girls were to the laughing</li>
<li>Let me fall badoo a day, let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>And fall badoo a day, let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>Fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>Oh, Robin had a young girl</li>
<li>Oh, Robin had a handsome girl</li>
<li>And while the mirror she was eschewing, oh</li>
<li>I slept in behind her hand</li>
<li>And quickly felt a courting, let me fall badoo a day</li>
<li>Let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>And fall badoo a day, let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>Oh, what do you think, my morning class</li>
<li>If you leave this careless father, oh</li>
<li>He has to keep you in bricks and clothes</li>
<li>And all together, let me fall badoo a day</li>
<li>Let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>Fall badoo a day, let me fall badoo a day, oh</li>
<li>Oh, oh</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
