<li>Alright, well, do I remember when first I went to sea?</li>
<li>I was a gay light-hearted youth as happy as could be.</li>
<li>For I longed to lead a sailor's life among the true and brave.</li>
<li>My heart is filled with my content as boundless as waves.</li>
<li>I have seen strange sights and seen since then, but nothing to my mind.</li>
<li>Like when I saw a tall ship per sailor spread to the wind.</li>
<li>I have roamed for many the night of day, midst gloomy mists and seas. But never do I once regret when first I went to sea.</li>
<li>I have saw the waves that round me dash, what a joy and sin are made.</li>
<li>I have all time saw a ship at sea, her bow were carried away. But never do I wish to change those things, where'er I be.</li>
<li>Or never do I once regret when first I went to sea.</li>
<li>I have saw the waves that round me dash, where men could never sail. I have saw the winds and heard them rinse and tatter every sail.</li>
<li>For I faced my death one hundred times, but providence proved good.</li>
<li>And years and years the storm has braved, and tempest I have stoned.</li>
<li>Oh, I have kept a midnight watch beneath those stormy skies.</li>
<li>I have listened to those seabirds scream their loud, abysmal cries. But on this dark domestic sea there is a secret still,</li>
<li>that only sailors know and fear. There's none but them can tell.</li>
<li>[The End]</li>
