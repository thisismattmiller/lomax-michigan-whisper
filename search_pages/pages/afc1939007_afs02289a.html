<li>I hope you will draw near to hear my lamentation.</li>
<li>I'm sure you'll drop a tear concerning a young fisherman.</li>
<li>He would your heart be wild.</li>
<li>He was drowned in Lake Michigan.</li>
<li>His name was Tommy Boyle.</li>
<li>When his father heard the news, the strike that he did run,</li>
<li>crying, Neighbors, dear, what shall I do?</li>
<li>I lost my darling son.</li>
<li>Like a pilgrim, I will wander.</li>
<li>And I'll travel many a mile.</li>
<li>And all my lifetime, I will mourn for my own son, Tommy Boyle.</li>
<li>When his sister heard the news, she dropped a silent tear.</li>
<li>She rang her hands in anguish, crying, Oh, my brother, dear.</li>
<li>What will I do with those wintry nights?</li>
<li>Or who will love me smile?</li>
<li>For my heart, it's almost breaking far.</li>
<li>My brother, Tommy Boyle, has a good son.</li>
<li>Reverend Father Gallagher, great praise to him as due.</li>
<li>He reconciled his father, and he preached the gospel too.</li>
<li>He prayed for his salvation.</li>
<li>The angels adorned him smiling.</li>
<li>And I hope he finds fun rest in paradise now</li>
<li>at Gallagher's Tommy Boyle.</li>
<li>He was proper tall and comely.</li>
<li>His age was 23.</li>
<li>He was this time a young man, as you would wish to see.</li>
<li>He was proper tall and kind to all, and on his face a smile.</li>
<li>And I hope he's well rewarded now at Gallagher's Tommy Boyle.</li>
<li>Now, to conclude and finish, dear Jack, you'll understand that was his brother, see.</li>
<li>I'm going to meet my mother, dear.</li>
<li>She's in that blessed land.</li>
<li>She was always, always kind and true to me.</li>
<li>And I thank you, dear little child, to sing your praise.</li>
<li>God rest your soul at Gallagher's Tommy Boyle.</li>
<li>A man here on this island, see, he was here, lived with us for a good many years.</li>
<li>You--</li>
<li>A man that composed the Long Green Song last time, what was his name?</li>
<li>Eh?</li>
<li>What was his name?</li>
<li>Dan Malloy.</li>
<li>Dan Malloy is another composer.</li>
<li>Was he a great singer?</li>
<li>Well, I don't know.</li>
<li>I never heard him sing in a song, but he composed the Gallagher song and Tommy Boyle song.</li>
<li>How did you learn it?</li>
<li>Well, I learned it from him.</li>
<li>I was living when he composed the song, see.</li>
<li>Well, where did you get the tune?</li>
<li>Eh?</li>
<li>Where did you learn the tune?</li>
<li>The tune?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>God, it's only the tune that runs up and down me eye, God forbid.</li>
<li>But I think I heard near there, wasn't I?</li>
<li>Didn't I, Don Richard?</li>
<li>Oh, not quite.</li>
<li>I don't recall.</li>
<li>Well, but that runs in a man, see.</li>
<li>We never heard anybody sing that song.</li>
<li>I just saw the words and made the tune myself.</li>
<li>Well, the old man sung the song, see.</li>
<li>And I don't know whether I fixed the tune from him or what.</li>
<li>But I thought I put a pretty good air on that, didn't I?</li>
<li>It was fine.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>How long ago did this happen?</li>
<li>Well, it happened-- it happened, I know, in '73.</li>
<li>That's the time.</li>
<li>That's how the Guy Gertz song tells you about that.</li>
<li>It was in October of '73.</li>
<li>That's Weber Harbor, the Atacanti.</li>
<li>They all went out on the same boat, see.</li>
<li>Same boat, see.</li>
