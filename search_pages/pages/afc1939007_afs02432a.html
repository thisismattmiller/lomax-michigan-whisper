<li>The New London Fair King May Fair May</li>
<li>Her parents, they told her that she was to blame</li>
<li>For she rambled and courted and flirted about</li>
<li>Till she once became a young girl of the town</li>
<li>So as green grows the laurel and as red grows the rose</li>
<li>Oh, sorry was I when I parted from home</li>
<li>But when I'll return, oh, my joy, sorry, no</li>
<li>I shall change the great laurel for the red, white, and blue</li>
<li>Oh, the first man I stayed with, his name was Jack Tarpe</li>
<li>His pants and his jacket did shine like the star</li>
<li>So he tipped me a wink and away we both went</li>
<li>And he played the fine tune on my young instrument</li>
<li>So as green grows the laurel and as red grows the rose</li>
<li>Oh, sorry was I when I parted from home</li>
<li>But when I'll return, oh, my joy, sorry, no</li>
<li>I shall change the great laurel for the red, white, and blue</li>
<li>Oh, the next man I stayed with, his name was Post By</li>
<li>He gave me ten shillings to call him his joy</li>
<li>So I called him my joy a thousand times more</li>
<li>And before he had left me, it cost him ten more</li>
<li>So as green grows the laurel and as red grows the rose</li>
<li>Oh, sorry was I when I parted from home</li>
<li>But when I'll return, oh, my joy, sorry, no</li>
<li>I shall change the great laurel for the red, white, and blue</li>
<li>Oh, my chiffon there of linen I own to the truth</li>
<li>And I have been outwith in many bright years</li>
<li>And beneath my navel there's a spring that flows clear</li>
<li>And it's worked more to me than one thousand a year</li>
<li>So as green grows the laurel and as red grows the rose</li>
<li>Oh, sorry was I when I parted from home</li>
<li>But when I'll return, oh, my joy, sorry, no</li>
<li>I shall change the great laurel for the red, white, and blue</li>
