<li>2297, A1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>A young man courted me earnestly and you may say that I did slough him,</li>
<li>for it was his false and his flattering tongue that deluded me, oh, when I was young.</li>
<li>It was in young Greenfield, oh, that we sat down, and nothing but small birds came hopping round,</li>
<li>and they changed their notes, oh, from three to three, as the sun arose over the Green Valley.</li>
<li>Oh, what need I talk about is a curly black hair, and his two blue eyes, they were beyond compare,</li>
<li>and it was his false and his flattering tongue that deluded me, oh, when I was young.</li>
<li>Come all you liars, lovers, a tale I will unfold concerning a young lady fair and a young sailor bold,</li>
<li>as they both converse together, young Henry did say, Stay home, my dear sailor lad, what makes you go away?</li>
<li>Do not leave me here heartbroken, in your absence to be wail, to think that you'd be talked about by every wind and gale,</li>
<li>and I will leave my parents and I'll rest just like a man, when I'll go and face the foe, your own love, Marianne.</li>
<li>Oh, no, my dearest dear, to that I won't agree, that you should leave your parents and go along with me,</li>
<li>for perhaps on board of a man of war, where all dangers to abide, that there's some angry cannonball might lay you by my side.</li>
<li>So stay at home, my dearest dear, and be advised by me, rely upon the honor of your faithful Henry,</li>
<li>and early the next morning, just by the break of the day, the archers came unto Spithead for to make haste away.</li>
<li>The captain cries out hands on deck, My boys make haste away, the anchors wait our gallant ship sails proudly through the bay.</li>
<li>And away out on the ocean, far from friends and home did steer, some were thinking of their own true loves, and more of their parents dear.</li>
<li>And when each one to his right laughs, and they toss a flowing can, Hooray, my boys, young Henry, cries, Here's a hell to Marianne.</li>
<li>Well, we cruised about through different parts, for three long years or more, and one day the archers came on board to steer for England's shore,</li>
<li>back to that land that they gave us birth, well, those we held most dear.</li>
<li>And they captained his happy fortune, and they captained life to save, whilst off the coast of Africa they struggled in the waves.</li>
<li>They plunged themselves into the deep, whereby the waves were tossed, and if the boat lay one moment more, the captain would be lost.</li>
<li>And now that we are landed, and to see that gallant crew, each bidding good-bye and parting, and bidding each other adieu.</li>
<li>And the captain gave him fifty pounds of that moment's heated land, and the very next day young Henry got to Marianne.</li>
<li>Come, all you true and vile demons, come listen to me whilst I'll explain.</li>
<li>It was on a passage, on a passage, on Barbaria, we shipped on aboard off the Martha Jane.</li>
<li>And now think of this cruel torturer, without a friend you all may know.</li>
<li>You whips, you mangles, you gags and strangles, that British seaman, Andy Rose.</li>
<li>Up on deck, the captain laid him, beat him with an iron bar, and the captain swore he would dare release him, his life he would no longer spare.</li>
<li>And now think of that cruel torturer, without a friend you all may know, you whips, you mangles, you gags and strangles, that British seaman, Andy Rose.</li>
<li>And a water tank he threw him, for nine long hours he left him there, and the captain swore he would dare release him, his life he would no longer spare.</li>
<li>And up aloft the captain sent him, naked to a biling sun, and miles the ocean followed after, and beat him till his blood did run.</li>
<li>And now think of that cruel torturer, without a friend you all may know, you whips, you mangles, you gags and strangles, that British seaman, Andy Rose.</li>
<li>The captain gave him food to swallow, and what it was I won't explain, but it made the ship's crew shrink with horror, who sailed on board off the Martha again.</li>
