<li>AFS recording number 2333, side B.</li>
<li>Way out in California, a happy driving day.</li>
<li>We're planning for the Christmas, not very far away.</li>
<li>They had a little daughter, a sweet and goodly child. And all the folks that knew her, the Mary and Parker smile.</li>
<li>She'll ask her home one morning, for soon that's our week. And no one dreams that danger will come to her that day.</li>
<li>But a murderous villain with Dean's heart of stone, so just as old Mary and I wait them since then home.</li>
<li>And then they caught the collar, John Hickman was their man. They brought him back to justice, his final trial to stand.</li>
<li>Now this song is a warning to parents far and dear. We can't let John too closely the ones we love so dear.</li>
<li>Now these two ballads, The Girl and the Blue Velvet Band and The Murder of Mary and Parker were sung by Alan Pope of St. Ignace, Michigan on September the 11th, 1938 for the Library of Congress.</li>
<li>How old are you, Pope?</li>
<li>Twenty.</li>
<li>And where did you learn the song?</li>
<li>Well I learned that one from my sister and the Blue Velvet Band I learned from a friend of mine.</li>
<li>(upbeat music)</li>
