<li>Well, I laughed all consoling to Scorson, I didn't mind much what I'd say,</li>
<li>With Eleanor Quartz in the barn with a bundle of straw for to bed.</li>
<li>For the blood in my veins boiled to madness, do you think that a man is a law?</li>
<li>Well, I tracked him once more 'twas the last time, and shot him that night like a dog.</li>
<li>Yes, I shot him, I did it, but father, let them that make laws for the land.</li>
<li>Look to it when they come to judgment for the blood that lies red on my hands.</li>
<li>If I drew the piece 'twas them crime did that left him stretch cold on the sod.</li>
<li>And from their bar where I got my sentence, I appeal to the bar of my God.</li>
<li>For the justice I never got from them, the right in their hands is unknowing.</li>
<li>Still I'll say, sir, at last that I'm sorry I took the law into my own.</li>
<li>That I stole out that night in the darkness, whilst mad with my grief and despair.</li>
<li>And I drew the black soul from his body, not giving him time for a prayer.</li>
<li>Well, it is told, sir, you have the whole story.</li>
<li>God forgive him and me for my sins.</li>
<li>My life now is ended, oh father, for the young ones, for them life began.</li>
<li>You look to poor Ellen John Orton, God bless you, and now I'm at rest.</li>
<li>And resign to the death that tomorrow is staring me straight in the face.</li>
<li>Composed by Catherine Murphy and fetched across the ocean seventy-five years ago by Mary Ellen Roddick.</li>
<li>And the son, her son that's singing the song, Andrew Gallagher.</li>
<li>Where? Where? St. James.</li>
<li>St. James.</li>
<li>Now you play it over the black yard. Now is that something to remember?</li>
<li>Oh, that's a beauty.</li>
<li>Beauty? Yes, and I defy another God damn man in this country can sing that.</li>
<li>Is it true, Tom?</li>
<li>Yes, it's true, you're sitting on that bench.</li>
<li>Were they really like that in Ireland, those black poets?</li>
<li>Well, that's the way they were in Ireland in those days, man, that's why the people came to America on account of the laws.</li>
<li>Why, absolutely, that's the positive truth.</li>
<li>You see, he was a Catholic, and he was confessing, that's his confession.</li>
<li>He sentenced to death as a name, let's see.</li>
<li>And he was making his confession to the priest before he'd be hung, do you understand?</li>
<li>And the landlord was a turn, he paid his rent, but they shoved it down and may doubt he didn't,</li>
<li>and put him out of his home, the one of the home, do you understand?</li>
<li>Yeah, hell is enough in those days for a landlord to get shot, see.</li>
