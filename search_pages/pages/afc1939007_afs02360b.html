<li>>> Twenty-three-sixty-B.</li>
<li>>> Come all you poor hearers and listen to me.</li>
<li>I will sing you the praises of John Morrissey,</li>
<li>who has lately been challenged for 12,000 pounds</li>
<li>to fight Ned, the black man from Albany Town.</li>
<li>Five, six in the morning, both stripped to the buff,</li>
<li>both stripped to the buff and jumped in the ring.</li>
<li>You lay down that belt now, the black, he did say,</li>
<li>or your life I will take in the ring on this day.</li>
<li>Then Morris bolted into the ring like a lion,</li>
<li>saying, Here stands the bones of an Irishman here,</li>
<li>who has never been conquered by white, black, or brown.</li>
<li>He belongs to Tipperary with Irish all around,</li>
<li>who has never been conquered this whole world around,</li>
<li>and he belongs to Tipperary with Irish all around.</li>
<li>Oh, the first round was fought and the Irish did cry.</li>
<li>Three cheers for our country, hurrah you me boys,</li>
<li>and never for bribery our country disowned.</li>
<li>This day we have bet all we're worth on your bones.</li>
<li>Oh, the third, fourth, and fifth round was fought in weight style.</li>
<li>The third, fourth, and fifth round and up to the tenth,</li>
<li>when Morris received several blows on the belt.</li>
<li>And from that to the 14th, severely knocked down,</li>
<li>and he bled from his ears as he lay on the ground.</li>
<li>Oh, the blood from his ears, it run down his back.</li>
<li>And the Irish all cried, he'd be killed by the black.</li>
<li>But revived by a second, Johnny unsurprised,</li>
<li>he run and jumped into the ring like a lion.</li>
<li>And he made for the black with such a mighty full stroke.</li>
<li>Sure, he left him not dead, but the ribs of him broke.</li>
<li>Here's a help to Jack Morrissey, who has trod on our soil.</li>
<li>He conquered those duffers from over the main,</li>
<li>and never for bribery our country disowned.</li>
<li>He belongs to Tipperary with Irish all around.</li>
<li>Is that it?</li>
<li>Where did that come from?</li>
<li>Well, sir, I couldn't say.</li>
<li>I heard it before I was big enough to work there.</li>
<li>Seven or eight years old, I think.</li>
<li>There were old fellas singing it.</li>
<li>They picked it up around the corner.</li>
<li>All right.</li>
<li>Do you know whether that was a fall or what?</li>
<li>No, sir, I do not, sir.</li>
<li>It was before my time, I guess.</li>
<li>[VIDEO PLAYBACK]</li>
<li>- The following song was sung by John Norman in Munising, Michigan,</li>
<li>September the 18th, 1938.</li>
<li>The roving-- the raving-- the raving-- the raving-- the raving--</li>
<li>the red boy, sandy boy, one night I came-- one night I</li>
<li>came home to my-- come home to my-- come home to my--</li>
<li>Bonnie Scott Brown Bull, the black sheep, Jack Haggerty,</li>
<li>the ram of Derby, the wild colonial boy, the stowaway--</li>
<li>stowaway-- and Jack Morrissey.</li>
<li>Now, Mr. Norman lives near Vanmere, Michigan,</li>
<li>on 160 acres where he's squatted for the last 14 years.</li>
<li>He is an old-time lumberjack.</li>
