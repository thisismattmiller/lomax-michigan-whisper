<li>2264, B1, 2, 3 & 4</li>
<li>When you go out on a Grancombe, now you want a hip-trick of very style, with one end sharp</li>
<li>and the other end bent, and that way for the Grancombe hunter.</li>
<li>So hunt you hunters, hunt all night till broad day light, the skinnier coon in the morning.</li>
<li>Oh, when the old hunter takes a gun in his hand, look out the old coon, your hide will get tanned.</li>
<li>Behind the gutter and behind the bog, you'll take that stick and give the coon a jug.</li>
<li>So hunt you hunters, hunt all night till broad day light, the skinnier coon in the morning.</li>
<li>Oh, when the old hunter spites a coon under him, look high, he says, Oh coon, that you must die.</li>
<li>He levels away with his old smoothbore and the rifle-bore mixer raccoon's horse.</li>
<li>So hunt you hunters, hunt all night till broad day light, the skinnier coon in the morning.</li>
<li>That's all it is.</li>
<li>That ain't good with the dam, I didn't get the tune. You see, I didn't get out that tune that got in.</li>
<li>They dug the bank, waded and ended the row and held a bag over the end of the row</li>
<li>and caught the potatoes when they come rolling down the hill.</li>
<li>We was getting out a pile of logs one winter on around the river.</li>
<li>We cut our logs and we'd hang them on the river.</li>
<li>In the spring, when the ice and snow went off, we started to swing drive logs.</li>
<li>Well, we drove old logs downstream for a couple of weeks.</li>
<li>We'd come to a set of camps that looked just like old Paul's camps.</li>
<li>So we drove for a couple of weeks more and we'd come to a set that looked just like old Paul's.</li>
<li>So we started the third week and we began to think there might be something wrong.</li>
<li>So when we, two weeks it up, we'd come to the set of camps again and we went ashore.</li>
<li>And sure enough, it was old Paul's camps.</li>
<li>And there we'd been driving old logs right around, around, around, around the river all that time.</li>
<li>We never knew no difference.</li>
<li>We didn't know that that river didn't have no beginning, no end.</li>
<li>We just rode the circle.</li>
<li>So we was up against it.</li>
<li>We hadn't saved our logs.</li>
<li>So we hit up old babe, big blue ox on the breaking pole,</li>
<li>and we pulled her far over from the round river into Manistee.</li>
<li>Pulled her to logs down the river, down the fur into Manistee and saved her logs.</li>
<li>That was the winter, cold winter that we had such a big crew.</li>
<li>The cooks couldn't keep the salt and pepper shakers full.</li>
<li>They'd all fagged out from running back and forth trying to keep the shakers full.</li>
<li>And you know how Lumberjack liked salt for his beans?</li>
<li>Well, Paul and me got the idea of hitting a team of iron grays on the salt and pepper wagon.</li>
<li>So I drove that team on the salt and pepper wagon up and down the table in the cook shack</li>
<li>all the rest of that winter except Sundays.</li>
<li>Sundays we'd have prunes for breakfast.</li>
<li>And they'd take me all day to haul the prune pits out.</li>
<li>I guess we've got enough of it.</li>
<li>Did you call out to get mad at anybody?</li>
<li>I don't know.</li>
<li>Did you get it on there now? Did you get it on there now? Did you get it on there now?</li>
<li>It was on one bright May morning, a sparkling blaze adieu.</li>
<li>I was on my way from Jackson where I was forced to go.</li>
<li>The curse on George the Gator gave me no credit gain.</li>
<li>But my heart was sore within me from the lake upon the train.</li>
<li>Over a low tide and crossing I wound my weary way.</li>
<li>Two snakes and alligators my weary feet did stray.</li>
<li>Until the gate of evening some higher ground I gained.</li>
<li>And there I met this real girl on the lake upon the train.</li>
<li>Good evening my petty fair maid, my money does me no good.</li>
<li>If it wasn't for the alligators I'd sleep out in the woods.</li>
<li>You're welcome to our cottage although our fair is plain.</li>
<li>We never turn a stranger out on the lake upon the train.</li>
<li>I tried to paint her beauty but it was all in vain.</li>
<li>So handsome was this real girl on the lake upon the train.</li>
<li>Her hair strung in ring but it on her shoulder fell.</li>
<li>Drag that thing out, drag that thing out, drag that thing out.</li>
<li>Thank you.</li>
