<li>My brave young river man, wherever you may be</li>
<li>I hope you'll pay attention to those lines you'll hear from me</li>
<li>It's about some gay young river man, so manly, true and brave</li>
<li>All on the jam at Jerry's Rock, they met their watery grave</li>
<li>It was early Sunday morning, as you shall plainly hear</li>
<li>The logs were piled up mountain high, we could not keep them clear</li>
<li>Our foreman cried, Roll out, brave boys, with hearts devoid of fear</li>
<li>To break the jam on Jerry's Rock, and for Mary town we'll steer</li>
<li>Oh, some of them being willing, while others did hang back</li>
<li>All for to work on Sunday, they did not think it right</li>
<li>The old six Canadian shanty boys did volunteer and go</li>
<li>To break the jam on Jerry's Rock, for the foreman young Monroe</li>
<li>Though they had not rolled off many logs from the foreman, he did say</li>
<li>I'd have you on your guard, brave boys, for this jam will soon give way</li>
<li>Those words were scarcely spoken when the jam did break and go</li>
<li>And carried away those six brave boys for the foreman young Monroe</li>
<li>When the rest of all the shanty boys, those sad tidings they did hear</li>
<li>In search of their dead bodies to the river they drew near</li>
<li>And among their lifeless bodies to their sad grief and woe</li>
<li>All out and mangled on the beach was the one, a young Monroe</li>
<li>For they picked him from the waters, combed back his raven hair</li>
<li>There was one fair foreman among them, whose cries did rent the air</li>
<li>There was one fair foreman among them, a maid from Saginaw town</li>
<li>Whose screams and cries did rent the skies for her lover who was drowned</li>
<li>Mrs. Clare, she being a widow, lived by the river bend</li>
<li>She had a daughter, Mary, likewise the raftman's friend</li>
<li>The rest of her lover's wages the boss to her did pay</li>
<li>Likewise a liberal subscription she received from the boys that day</li>
<li>Oh, we buried him right decently 'cause on the tenth of May</li>
<li>Now shanty boys, for you'll come ridge, I hope that you will pray</li>
<li>And on a hemlock tree we placed his name that it would show</li>
<li>The day, the date and the rounding fate of our foreman young Monroe</li>
<li>How long ago did you learn that, Mr.?</li>
<li>Oh, twenty years, I guess.</li>
<li>Where, do you remember?</li>
<li>Well, I was right at home when I learned that. I wasn't in the woods then.</li>
<li>Where is home?</li>
<li>About five miles west of Travers here.</li>
<li>In what township?</li>
<li>Elmwood.</li>
<li>Yeah, Bladonall County.</li>
<li>Do you know that that really happened?</li>
<li>No, I couldn't say.</li>
<li>I know some that did really happen, but I don't know whether that did or not.</li>
<li>No, I couldn't say.</li>
