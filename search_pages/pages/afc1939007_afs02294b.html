<li>Ah, won't you all experience the evil they steal,</li>
<li>that hinders young people from their will?</li>
<li>For once they're bowed and their love they give,</li>
<li>you can never part with them while they're there.</li>
<li>Do you think that's a true story or not?</li>
<li>Oh, God, how could I tell?</li>
<li>It's hard to believe it.</li>
<li>He had jives in the meantime and then his ghost came after him.</li>
<li>Well, when you said when they came to her father's home,</li>
<li>you were feeling so bad, didn't you say his father's home?</li>
<li>When they came to her father's home.</li>
<li>I thought they'd left that place.</li>
<li>Huh?</li>
<li>I thought she was not welcome in father's home.</li>
<li>Well, the father sent her away, you know, on the first place,</li>
<li>for her to detain her on her wedding day.</li>
<li>And then the young man died.</li>
<li>Then the young man died.</li>
<li>Of course, that doesn't come into the song at all,</li>
<li>but then his ghost appears.</li>
<li>Then one night if she was for her bed bound,</li>
<li>and she heard that voice of a deadly sound saying,</li>
<li>Break the bond, love, that we have bound.</li>
<li>Now I know a case of that.</li>
<li>She didn't know whether, she didn't even know before that she was dead.</li>
<li>No, no, she didn't know a thing about that thing.</li>
<li>But she was many miles away, probably hundreds of miles away,</li>
<li>and of course her horse back didn't even argue.</li>
<li>But I know the case right here on this island.</li>
<li>There's a girl that was married to a fellow and was dying.</li>
<li>She was engaged to that fellow.</li>
<li>And his father said to him he wanted to break that bond that they had made.</li>
<li>You know, I don't know how much I can do that.</li>
<li>It didn't sound like it.</li>
<li>No, no.</li>
<li>But it seemed that that was an old Irish tradition that --</li>
<li>What does it mean to break the bond?</li>
<li>To break that engagement.</li>
<li>They called it a bond, break that bond, love, that we have bound.</li>
<li>Oh, garment, you look healthy now, your dress so only and clean.</li>
<li>And I do not see you drunk about.</li>
<li>Come tell me where you've been.</li>
<li>Your wife and children now are well.</li>
<li>You once did use them strange and you are kinder to them grown.</li>
<li>How came that happy came?</li>
<li>It was a warning vice that heaven sent to me.</li>
<li>That woke me from a drunkard's curse, crime, want, and misery.</li>
<li>My wages were all spent in drinks, oh, what a wretched view.</li>
<li>I nearly broke my poor wife's heart and starved my children too.</li>
<li>What was a home?</li>
<li>Her wife told me I heated at her side.</li>
<li>Our babes on straw and sickness lay, I heard their people cry.</li>
<li>And the children, they have offed a wolf, oh, Father dear, they've fed.</li>
<li>Poor mother has been weeping, so because we had no bread.</li>
<li>And I thought one night I staggered home, there seemed a solemn bloom.</li>
<li>I missed my wife, where could she be, and strangers in the room.</li>
<li>And the neighbor said, poor thing, she's gone, she has led a wretched life.</li>
<li>For grief and want has broken her heart, so willed to be a drunkard's wife.</li>
<li>And I saw my children weeping round, and I scurriedly blew my breath.</li>
<li>Oh, Father, come and wake her up.</li>
<li>And the people said, she's dead, oh, make her talk, and smile one more, we will never cry for bread.</li>
<li>Now that's another one. That's the one I had a fortune that I thought would never be sent.</li>
<li>Did it make a record of that one?</li>
<li>Well, go nether.</li>
<li>No?</li>
<li>Once I had a fortune, and I thought it never was to spend.</li>
<li>But I spent it all in gambling one night when I got drunk.</li>
<li>Then early the next morning the boys all around me came.</li>
<li>And we all got on a bender, and I got drunk again.</li>
<li>And then I kept on drinking and spending all my store, gambling and carousing till I hadn't any more.</li>
<li>Then sickness took a hold of me, which wrecked my bones with pain, and the doctors told me I would die if I got drunk again.</li>
<li>Then I started on a journey for to bid my friend goodbye, and the tears of sorrow melted me, and I told them I would try</li>
<li>to leave a foolish habit while life would remain, and no matter in what company would I get drunk again.</li>
<li>Then I started back to New York town I went. I went to California for to raise a pile, and I prospered over mountains, and I worked quite hard a while.</li>
<li>But disappointments met me there in every lawn and plane, and I got quite discouraged, and I got drunk again.</li>
<li>And back to New York town I came out for to get a wife, and resolved was I to marry and lead a sober life.</li>
<li>And I married one, a handsome one, and happy was I then, until our first child was born, and I got drunk again.</li>
<li>Now come all you jolly young fellows, repent whilst you've got the time, or you'll break your constitution by drinking too much wine.</li>
<li>You will bring yourselves to poverty, for friends are great and same, and all you'll have is the horrors by getting drunk again.</li>
