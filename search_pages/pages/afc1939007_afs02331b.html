<li>A.F.S. recording number two, three, three, one, side bays, drips one, two, three and four.</li>
<li>Merry life cares for a bullet dying in a crimping club.</li>
<li>Tell my brother in the army on Potomac's sunny shore,</li>
<li>That our navy is victorious and always be so evermore.</li>
<li>There he lies, pierced of docking, gently he'll lift up his breast.</li>
<li>Oh, a heavenly smile lift up his features, then his eyes were closed in death.</li>
<li>Oh, the quick sunny south was in peace and content,</li>
<li>When the scenes of my childhood I carelessly spent,</li>
<li>To those wide and spreading plains, from those clear and pearly streams,</li>
<li>Ever dear to my memory, ever sweet to my dreams.</li>
<li>Oh, Father, dear Father, for me do not weep.</li>
<li>Oh, Father, dear Father, for me do not weep,</li>
<li>To those wild and lonely mansions I'm longed for to sleep,</li>
<li>With my knapsack for my pillow and my rifle in my hand,</li>
<li>I am going in descent of my own dear native land.</li>
<li>Oh, Mother, dear Mother, for me do not weep.</li>
<li>Oh, your good and kind advice, oh, forever will I keep.</li>
<li>You have taught me to be brave from a boy to a man,</li>
<li>Now I'm going in descent of my own dear native land.</li>
<li>Oh, time will come to pass when we all shall be free,</li>
<li>Oh, both unions and Yankees, our land they'll be free,</li>
<li>And the wars will soon be over and our troubles will be gone,</li>
<li>And we'll haste to our dear ones that we left at home.</li>
<li>What kind of a song is that?</li>
<li>That is the, uh, The sweet, sunny south was in peace and content.</li>
<li>The times of my boyhood I carelessly spent.</li>
<li>That's the first of the two.</li>
<li>Kentucky?</li>
<li>That's a southern song.</li>
<li>Well, Kentucky is in the south.</li>
<li>Yeah, I'm sure it is from one of those states, anyway.</li>
<li>It says, The sweet, sunny south.</li>
<li>It wasn't a union song then, was it?</li>
<li>Oh, no, it was a southern song.</li>
<li>Our country was in peace, see?</li>
<li>Yeah, I know what you mean.</li>
<li>You mean that the southern got it for a song.</li>
<li>Yeah, I do.</li>
