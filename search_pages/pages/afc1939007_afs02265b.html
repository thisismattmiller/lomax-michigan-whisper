<li>2265, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>After supper was over, Mark Kaluski appeared with a belt ready made for his big spottish steers.</li>
<li>To form it, he'd torn up his best mackinaw, for he swore he'd conduct it according to law.</li>
<li>Then up spoke the scaler, Hold on you a while, for your big spottish steers are behind just one mile.</li>
<li>You've skidded one hundred and ten and no more, and the bold have you beaten by ten and a score.</li>
<li>The shanty did ring and Mark Kaluski did swear, as he tore up by hand full his long yellow hair.</li>
<li>Said he to Bull Garden, My colors I pull, so here take the belt for your little brown bull.</li>
<li>Here's health to Bull Garden and Kennebec down, the biggest day's work on the river they've done.</li>
<li>So fill up your glasses boys, fill them up full, we will drink to the health of the little brown bull.</li>
<li>(knock, knock, knock)</li>
<li>Huh?</li>
<li>(inaudible)</li>
<li>Yeah, sure that's...</li>
<li>(inaudible)</li>
<li>No, this was, I know where this song really originated.</li>
<li>It originated in Wisconsin. This was a really, this thing took place right here.</li>
<li>(inaudible)</li>
<li>Finally he got a supply of the cough medicine liniment.</li>
<li>So he thought he was going to make some butter, and he had no storehouse.</li>
<li>That big cow making about a ton of butter a day, piled it up right out near the camp.</li>
<li>The boys wondered what he was going to do with so much of that butter piled up outdoors there.</li>
<li>There was no use asking them any questions, they wouldn't get no decided answer, but they just kept piling up butter.</li>
<li>Finally the, finally the ice and snow went off, and he used that butter for the beast at Loggen Road,</li>
<li>and it enabled him to run his logging sleighs all summer.</li>
<li>Well how cold was it when you used to get it?</li>
<li>Well, just one particular winter you ready for more of it?</li>
<li>We were lumbering up on minus T, 68 degrees below zero and eight degrees of 16 inches long.</li>
<li>Throwed all the blazes and all the lanterns.</li>
<li>We couldn't blow them out, so we blowed them out and throwed them outdoors.</li>
<li>And in the spring when I saw it up, it set the whole north of Michigan on fire and burnt St. Mary's River in two.</li>
<li>So as up against it we had our logs in the river, so we wanted to save our logs.</li>
<li>So we had to contrive a plan to connect them two ends together, so we went at it.</li>
<li>We used a matchbox for a connection, connected the two ends together and got our logs out.</li>
<li>But that matchbox is still there and most people think it's St. Mary's Locks.</li>
<li>How did you happen to get acquainted with Paul?</li>
<li>Well, the way I happened to get acquainted with him, I had me to watch camp there.</li>
<li>That summer he happened to be around there and in the watching camp there was a side hill there.</li>
<li>And he wanted me to do my leisure time to plant some potatoes on that side hill.</li>
<li>So we got kind of figuring out how best to plant them.</li>
<li>I was supposed to plant them along the length of the hill and he was supposed to plant them up and down.</li>
<li>So we went at it. I thought it wouldn't dictate him.</li>
<li>And we planted them potatoes up and down that hill. It was quite steep.</li>
<li>I wondered what his I.D. was, but in a way I watched him and every time he planted a row,</li>
<li>I noticed he made quite a little bank down to the foot of the hill.</li>
<li>And we kept planting them, finally got them planted and worked them and hoed them.</li>
<li>When it come digging time, you know, we went down there and first thing we dug that little bank of dirt.</li>
<li>With man the road dirt, with man the road dirt, with man the road dirt.</li>
