<li>Come all young men and maiden, and listen to my song.</li>
<li>At 'tis but a few verses, and it won't draw 'ting you long,</li>
<li>Concerning the hardships that I did undergo,</li>
<li>For a comely young lassie called Sally Monroe.</li>
<li>Oh, for six long weeks or better, no word did I hear,</li>
<li>From that comely young lassie I once loved so dear,</li>
<li>Until one Monday morning down in a shady grove,</li>
<li>Oh, who did I spy but young Sally Monroe?</li>
<li>I asked her if she could come along with me,</li>
<li>To dine our hands in wedlock bands and marries we would be,</li>
<li>And she said she had no objection along with me to go,</li>
<li>If I would prove liable to Sally Monroe.</li>
<li>And to this fair damsel a letter I sent,</li>
<li>And I sent it with a young man, and I thought he was a friend,</li>
<li>But instead of being a friend he proved to be a foe,</li>
<li>For he never gave my letter to young Sally Monroe,</li>
<li>And he told her old mother first to beware of me,</li>
<li>For that I had a wife in my own country,</li>
<li>Oh, then said the mother, if this does be so,</li>
<li>He never will enjoy my young Sally Monroe.</li>
<li>Then for six long months or better no word did I hear,</li>
<li>From that handsome young lassie that I once had loved so dear,</li>
<li>Until one Monday morning down in a shady grove,</li>
<li>Oh, who did I spy but young Sally Monroe?</li>
<li>And I asked her if she could come along with me,</li>
<li>For to dine our hands in wedlock bands and marries we would be,</li>
<li>And she said she had no objection along with me to go,</li>
<li>If I would prove liable to Sally Monroe.</li>
<li>Oh, here is my heart love and here is my hand,</li>
<li>Until death shall separate us we never will part,</li>
<li>Then along the coast of Nury the next morning we did go,</li>
<li>And there I got married to young Sally Monroe.</li>
<li>Now you know only for you I would never think of that song.</li>
<li>They are different.</li>
<li>They went aboard on a ship and that ship went down.</li>
<li>There was none to be saved.</li>
<li>There is one among us known as Sally Monroe.</li>
