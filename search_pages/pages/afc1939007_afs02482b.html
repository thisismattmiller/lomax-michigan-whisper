<li>This was composed by Buddy Pittman concerning the meeting in the southern state.</li>
<li>There was four people in the party. One night held meeting in the church.</li>
<li>One was Papa Lowdown, Wap Mama, Sister Do-Daddy, and Heavy-Hippeded Mama.</li>
<li>All held the meeting in church. One prayed and one moaned while one sung a sacrosanct song.</li>
<li>Now the first thing on the program is a hymn that's given out by Brother Lowdown.</li>
<li>The name of the hymn is I love the Lord, He heard my cry and pitied every groan.</li>
<li>And a prayer given up by Sister Do-Daddy is Wap Mama refused to pray.</li>
<li>And in the midst of the prayer, Wap Mama gives the moan.</li>
<li>I just keep it telling you it's a God somewhere. That's something everybody don't believe.</li>
<li>The hymn, as I told you, is placed on the program.</li>
<li>[Music]</li>
<li>[Humming]</li>
<li>And pitied every groan.</li>
<li>[Humming]</li>
<li>Sister Lowdown, lead us in prayer.</li>
<li>I can't pray. Call on Wap Mama to pray.</li>
<li>She felt the spirit more than I did.</li>
<li>Wap Mama, hmm? Lead us in prayer.</li>
<li>This evening our Heavenly Father, here is once more to care.</li>
<li>That your poor weker number seven, has a remedy and bowed down at the footstool of mercy.</li>
<li>This evening, Lord, Lord, Lord, we call on you 'cause we know that you are God.</li>
<li>And beside you, there I know the God.</li>
<li>Please, please help the Father.</li>
<li>We ask you, Lord, in the walk in the midst of all meeting night,</li>
<li>search each and every vigil heart.</li>
<li>Please, Lord, please, please, Lord, help you find him.</li>
<li>We ask you to bid the moon as pretty as the east is from the west.</li>
<li>Nine, Lord, nine, nine, Lord.</li>
<li>You said having the Father.</li>
<li>That you the rock in the way we drive.</li>
<li>A shelter and a time to stand.</li>
<li>Please, Lord, please, please, Lord.</li>
<li>I ask you to go and stand by for Christ's sake. Amen.</li>
