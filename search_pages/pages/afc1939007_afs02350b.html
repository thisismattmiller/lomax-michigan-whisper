<li>I've taken my work where I found it, and now I must spend my time.</li>
<li>I've had lots of bombosses, and four of these guys were insane.</li>
<li>One was a limestone for a month, one was a retard boss, one was fast-witted playing brick and alert about working from him.</li>
<li>First I worked at the quarry, I worked there upon the drill.</li>
<li>The things I'd seen and done there would give you an awful thrill.</li>
<li>One man with both eyes out, one man caught under a train, one man was fast at making a blast and alert about working from him.</li>
<li>Then I worked at the retard, I worked there for quite a spell.</li>
<li>When out of the yard came old Westman, he sure made my work in hell. Standing by me for this first one, then filled me up to the brim.</li>
<li>I told him I guess he could set in the grass when I learned about working from him.</li>
<li>Then I worked at my room, a night watch four to be. The boss says, Oh, give your fellow, just listen unto me.</li>
<li>Fill the tanks up with water, fill the bunkers with coal. You do your best and the boys do the rest, and alert about working from him.</li>
<li>Now I've paid my work where I found it, and now I must pay for my work.</li>
<li>The boys I had to work with were always a trying teacher, and the end of it's thinking and working, and dreaming a foreman to be.</li>
<li>Be warned by my fate, quit all your ill thoughts, and learn about working from me.</li>
<li>I've taken my work where I found it, and now I must pay for my work.</li>
<li>The boys I had to work with were always a trying teacher, and the end of it's thinking and working, and hoping a foreman to be.</li>
<li>Be warned by my luck, which I know you will not, and learn about working from me.</li>
<li>- What's your name? - Mason Palmer. - Mason Palmer? - Palmer. - Palmer. Now how old are you? - Forty-nine.</li>
<li>- Michigan born? - Mm-hmm. - Worked in the Northern Peninsula? - Mm-hmm. For the last 28 years. - Eight years?</li>
<li>- When did you make up the song? - About ten years ago. - Have you sung it around a lot of places? - No, just around the place.</li>
<li>This song was sung by Mason Palmer in Newbury, Michigan, September the 16th, 1938.</li>
