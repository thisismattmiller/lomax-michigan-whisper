<li>2349, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>My love is like a little bird that flies from tree to tree.</li>
<li>And if she sees a dear bird, she thinks no more of me.</li>
<li>What makes you pull those springtime flowers?</li>
<li>Why don't you leave them there?</li>
<li>What makes you pull those springtime flowers and put them in my hair?</li>
<li>Oh, bring me back the girl I love. Oh, bring her back to me.</li>
<li>And if I had the one I love, what a happy boy I'd be.</li>
<li>I hate to see another boy sitting on my true love's knee.</li>
<li>I hate to see another boy in the place where I should be.</li>
<li>Oh, bring me back the girl I love. Oh, bring her back to me.</li>
<li>And if I had the one I love, what a happy boy I'd be.</li>
<li>Many a young Canadian boy left home and friends so dear,</li>
<li>a longing for excitement to Michigan this year.</li>
<li>In the space of three months after, a telegram would come</li>
<li>saying, Your boy's been killed in the lumbering woods</li>
<li>and his body will be sent home.</li>
<li>It's once I knew a charming lad. His name was Harry Dunn.</li>
<li>His father was a farmer in the township off of Dunn.</li>
<li>He had everything he wanted, a farm of good land.</li>
<li>But he only wished to have a time in the woods of Michigan.</li>
<li>He started for Bay City, and his way slowly bent.</li>
<li>He hired with the lumbering king for the woods at Pekin Island.</li>
<li>He worked a long three long months, and oft times did write home</li>
<li>saying, Soon the winter will be o'er, and then I will come home.</li>
<li>He rose one morning from his bunk. No smile did break his brow.</li>
<li>He called his chum outside the door, whose name was Charlie Lloyd,</li>
<li>saying, Charlie dear, I had a dream, which filled my heart with woe.</li>
<li>I fear there's something wrong at home. It's there I ought to go.</li>
<li>His comrade only laughed at him, which did him for a while,</li>
<li>saying, Harry dear, it's time we'd go. It's time we'd follow the plan.</li>
<li>They worked away till ten at last, along that fatal day,</li>
<li>when a hanging limb fell down on him, which crushed him to the plate.</li>
<li>His comrade gathered round to take the limb away, saying,</li>
<li>Charlie, you'll come down with me. You'll take my body down.</li>
<li>You'll ask my dear old mother what made me leave my home.</li>
<li>The next morning the coffin was brought down, containing all that was left on earth</li>
<li>of poor young Harry Dunn. His mother, when she saw him, she fell down like a stone.</li>
<li>The poor, old aged father, he lingered for a while, but never, never passed forward.</li>
<li>He never was known to smile.</li>
<li>In a space of three months after, they buried the poor old man.</li>
<li>So now you see the deadly curse on the woods of Michigan.</li>
<li>(paper rustling)</li>
