<li>2354A</li>
<li>One evening as autumn was breaking,</li>
<li>parking in the darkness our own.</li>
<li>In numbers the Indians were gathering,</li>
<li>approaching the Niagara Falls.</li>
<li>Thou law's accretation had taught them, that one of their number each year,</li>
<li>with lots of head cast and head rubbed,</li>
<li>them could go down the falls without fear.</li>
<li>The chieftain he had but one daughter, he loved her as dear as his life.</li>
<li>Possessing the bravery he taught her, she feared not the loss of her life.</li>
<li>They thought the chieftain would grant them, to have them to look over once more.</li>
<li>But nothing unfair would he grant them, as he left them and walked down the shore.</li>
<li>A coffin for new and a paddle, lay waiting for her to step in.</li>
<li>Long farewell to pony and paddle, long farewell to forest and kin.</li>
<li>But yes as the moonbeams were brightening, to guide her boat with its bright gleam,</li>
<li>she furiously out in the boat, went and later lay rowed down the street.</li>
<li>All breathless and still as the evening, were those who stood on the shore.</li>
<li>[music]</li>
<li>All breathless and still as the evening, were those who stood on the shore.</li>
<li>So gently now down the steamy street, so soon to be seen evermore.</li>
<li>And as quick as a flash of the light, glimpsed a boat with scenes spanning the tide.</li>
<li>And just as the moonbeams were brightening, her father sat down by her side.</li>
<li>Oh see how he loved his daughter, he has taken a seat by her side.</li>
<li>Together now down the swift waters, how rapid, how quickly they glide.</li>
<li>And a shot from the shore of the river, broke forth about piercing cries.</li>
<li>From a mother who makes her heart quiver, poor Cheaton and daughter must die.</li>
<li>Down, down the swift waters, he sends a call, Cheaton and child.</li>
<li>Oh look, see they go under, he's rage wild.</li>
<li>It's the love of the daughter more greater, in the home of the white bear duty.</li>
<li>It's the love of the father more greater, than that of the great starry way.</li>
<li>What did you say you wanted to tell?</li>
<li>I learned that from Earl Pettis.</li>
<li>About six years ago I learned that.</li>
<li>No, tell me about it.</li>
<li>No I don't, but that song is an old, old song, and I've heard my father sing that.</li>
<li>Oh 40 years ago, easy.</li>
<li>It's supposed to be a true song, of the Indians at the Niger Falls.</li>
<li>That was their belief, that there had to be an Indian, one person go to the falls, they draw a lot.</li>
<li>And the lot tells their Cheaton's daughter, and he went over with it.</li>
