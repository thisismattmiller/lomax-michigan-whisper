<li>2279A I am a nobleminded man, Cole Younger is my name.</li>
<li>Of my many a depredation, my friends I brought to shame.</li>
<li>The robbing of the Northfield Bank am the same I will never deny.</li>
<li>And it leaves me a life prisoner in Stillwater Jail to die.</li>
<li>The first of my many robberies, I mean to let you know,</li>
<li>was a poor Californian, a miner lad, and far the same I rode.</li>
<li>We took from him his money, my boys, and we bade him go his way,</li>
<li>for which I will be sorry until my dying day.</li>
<li>Then after getting his money, my brother Bob did say,</li>
<li>it is now we'll buy fast horses, and from home we'll ride away.</li>
<li>And we'll chase the mountain gorillas until our dying day.</li>
<li>Then we started out to Texas, to that good old one-star state,</li>
<li>and on Nebraska Prairie, the James byes we did meet.</li>
<li>With knives and revolvers, we there sat down to play,</li>
<li>drinking lots of good old brandy for to drive the blues away.</li>
<li>And the Union Pacific Railroad was the next we did surprise.</li>
<li>And robbing with our bloody hands would take tears unto your eyes.</li>
<li>And on Nebraska Prairie, there molded rings and body lies.</li>
<li>And then we left that pretty place, and northward we did go,</li>
<li>to that godforsaken country called Minnesota.</li>
<li>Our mind was fixed on Mankato Bank, my brother Bob did say,</li>
<li>if you undertake that job, I fear you'll rule the day.</li>
<li>Then we stationed out our pickets, and up to the bank did go.</li>
<li>And there behind the counter, I struck a deadly blow.</li>
<li>Oh, hand me out your money, byes, and make no long delay.</li>
<li>For we're the no good younger byes who give no time to pray.</li>
<li>Well, I read it in the story of the younger byes.</li>
<li>They then made for a swamp, and they were captured,</li>
<li>the most of all, by coal, I think, coal escaped.</li>
<li>They never found him?</li>
<li>No, he became a good citizen afterward.</li>
<li>Well, you read a book about this when you--</li>
<li>you didn't learn the song from the book,</li>
<li>though, you heard that before.</li>
<li>Well, lots of times these bandits weren't so bad</li>
<li>as they were made out to be.</li>
<li>They had to do it for their own good.</li>
