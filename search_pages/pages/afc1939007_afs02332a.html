<li>A.F.S. recording, number 2332, site A, strips 1 and 2.</li>
<li>When I was thinking in the West and filled with lingering rays,</li>
<li>and beneath those cold mountains, where a dying soldier lay,</li>
<li>oh, beneath those cold mountains and southern sulfury skies,</li>
<li>far from his home in Texas, they laid him there to die.</li>
<li>A group had gathered round him, his comrades in the fight,</li>
<li>and the tears rolled down their mental cheeks as they bid him, oh, last goodnight.</li>
<li>Oh, comrades, crawl up nearer and listen to what, listen to what I say.</li>
<li>There is one thing I want to tell you, for my spirit passed away,</li>
<li>way out in Northwest Texas.</li>
<li>That good old state of mine, my spirit passed away.</li>
<li>Way out in Northwest Texas, that good old sorry state,</li>
<li>there is one cheese-weight might coming, her little heart to weight.</li>
<li>This thing is a little hard.</li>
<li>There's no effect.</li>
<li>I was thinking in the West, the sun was sinking in the West,</li>
<li>and filled with lingering rays, oh, beneath those cold mountains,</li>
<li>oh, beneath those cold branches where a dying ranger lay,</li>
<li>oh, beneath those cold mountains and southern sulfury skies,</li>
<li>far from his home in Texas, they laid him there to die.</li>
<li>Come, a group had gathered round him, his comrades in the fight.</li>
<li>His comrades gathered round him, a group had gathered round him,</li>
<li>his comrades in the fight.</li>
<li>And the tears rolled down their mantle cheeks as he bid his last goodnight.</li>
<li>Oh, comrades now around me, oh, do not cry for me.</li>
<li>I am crossing a dark river to a country I know is free.</li>
<li>And now comrades now way round me, come listen to what I say.</li>
<li>I want to tell a story, for my spirit has to way.</li>
<li>Way out in Northwest Texas, that good old state of mine,</li>
<li>that is one who weights might coming, her little heart will weight.</li>
<li>There is a fair young girl, my sister, my darling and my pride.</li>
<li>I have been to her a brother, and all this world beside.</li>
<li>I have been to her a brother, and with a brother's care,</li>
<li>through all my trials and hardships, her little heart still cares.</li>
<li>Oh, this country then, this country then invaded.</li>
<li>This country was invaded and called for volunteers.</li>
<li>I picked my loving sister, and her eyes were filled with tears,</li>
<li>saying go my dearest brother, and cry, and cry, and cry.</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
