<li>2266, A1 and 2.</li>
<li>Down by the wild mustard river, down by the old emery dam, we are old from our blanket</li>
<li>one morning to flood from the reservoir dam.</li>
<li>When the waters come rustling and rolling, our PVs and pikes, we'd apply, not thinking</li>
<li>that one of our numbers this day had so horribly to die.</li>
<li>On the river there was none any better, on the log than our friend Johnny Stile.</li>
<li>He had worked there more than any other, but he always was reckless and wild.</li>
<li>But today his luck went against him, his put-it was caught in the jam.</li>
<li>And you know how that creek runs a-howling, when you flood from the reservoir dam.</li>
<li>But we were all there in a moment, just as soon as he gave his first shout.</li>
<li>And you know how that creek runs a-howling, it rolls in but it never rolls out.</li>
<li>We worked for an hour and a quarter, we worked till our time come to spare.</li>
<li>And we had a whole well work through her, when like lightning she hauled out of there.</li>
<li>We rode her down and pulled up in dead water, we worked till the sweat down us poured.</li>
<li>We pulled his dead body from in under, but it looked like poor Johnny no more.</li>
<li>His flesh was all cut up in ringlets, and rolled out as flat as your hand.</li>
<li>We'll hold peace on this earth for his body, while the Lord holds his soul in command.</li>
<li>A lot of people wondered where Paul Bunyan was born, but he was born in Maine.</li>
<li>When he was three weeks old, he was such a lummix of a kid that he wallowed around so much in his sleep</li>
<li>that he rolled down four square miles standing timber.</li>
<li>When the natives wouldn't stand for that, so they built him a floating cradle and anchored it out at East Port, Maine.</li>
<li>Every time he rocked in that cradle, he caused a seventy-five foot tide in the Bay of Fundy.</li>
<li>And it destroyed several villages and lost lots of lives.</li>
<li>And when he got to sleep, he couldn't wake him however, so they called the British Navy out and they fired broadside for seven hours.</li>
<li>And when they did wake him, he was excited over so much excitement that he tumbled overboard into the ocean.</li>
<li>And he waved the water sword and sunk seven more ships.</li>
<li>So the Navy wouldn't stand for that, so they captured his cradle, and out of the cradle they made seven more ships.</li>
<li>And the tide in the Bay of Fundy isn't gone yet.</li>
<li>Were you ready for it?</li>
<li>Well, his dad was a great fellow about clearing land.</li>
<li>He'd take the trees out as he'd come to them.</li>
<li>He'd hit the big poi up in the tree and the rope, and he'd go to digging.</li>
<li>And he'd pull the tree over.</li>
<li>Finally this one, the oxen, the yoga oxen, they started to go just about the time they hooked it and they didn't have time to get down out of the tree.</li>
<li>So they started hauling, they hauled that tree, and they hadn't been chopping any around it.</li>
<li>They pulled it clear almost to the ground, and the rope broke, and the tree flipped back, and it flipped Paul Bunyan clear up here on the Manatee River.</li>
<li>Well, he went a little over, and finally he got him a big ox.</li>
<li>It was an ox, it was a monster, it was the biggest ox there was in the world, it was seven max, and it was white between its eyes.</li>
<li>And he didn't stop till it built skid waves and like that, he'd just hit on a quarter section of land, haul it up the river, and sift the logs out of it, and put them into the river and hit the old bed, the big blue ox, on the rubbish and haul it back where it had come from.</li>
<li>Well, he heard tell of a big cow down in Vermont that mated that ox for size, the ox being six-hacks, and white between the eyes, the cow was recommended to be equally as large, so he got in touch with him down there, and he made a deal for the cow.</li>
<li>He was lumbering up here on the Manatee, so he took the big ox that morning, and what started for Vermont, he got down there that day and took the big ox with him to tuck him along, he stayed that night, and the next day he brought the cow back, and they landed back in Manatee.</li>
<li>Well, she'd have proved to have been a great record milker, but he turned her out on evergreens, that meant evergreen boughs and balsam boughs, the milk got so strong they couldn't use it on the table, all it was good for.</li>
