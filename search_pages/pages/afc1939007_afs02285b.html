<li>2285B.</li>
<li>I'm Paul Young, and I pray at 10 for those few lines I write.</li>
<li>My mind was then drawn rambling, and so I felt that I took my flight.</li>
<li>I hired with a merchant of honor and renown, and with him I lived quite happy until a fortune became the crown.</li>
<li>He had one only daughter, a tall, a beautiful, and fair, and this maid, she fell in love with me.</li>
<li>She's now in a deep despair, and when her father came to hear that whose life she will make known,</li>
<li>oh, she owned, she loved me dearly, like the causes of me to her own. Oh, one day as this fair maiden was walking along the strand,</li>
<li>her father's ship she despised, and the captain adjusted land. She goes on to the captain, and she offered him fifty pounds,</li>
<li>offered to tell her father that young Jimmie was drowned. That young Jimmie by a swelling wave was tossed right overboard.</li>
<li>Oh, kindly he embraced it, and now he's gone away, offered to tell her father what had happened.</li>
