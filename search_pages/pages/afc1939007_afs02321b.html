<li>A.F.S. recording number two, three, two, one, side B, strips one, two, three, and four.</li>
<li>Was Nellie the milkmaid so handsome and so gay?</li>
<li>The front of a band fan going to a spade.</li>
<li>It's one joke to give and another fur to take, says Nellie to the mistress.</li>
<li>May I go to the wake with my Half-Alder Lane?</li>
<li>Says the mistress to Nellie, I'd have you to beware.</li>
<li>For sure as you go, young Roger, he'll be there.</li>
<li>He'll take you in his arm and he'll do to you some harm,</li>
<li>and you'll be sorry coming home in the morn with your Half-Alder Lane.</li>
<li>Nellie, she get ready, was out upon the way,</li>
<li>wishing all the time that Roger, he'd be there.</li>
<li>He'll take me in his arm and he'll shield me from all harm,</li>
<li>and I won't be sorry coming home in the morn with my Half-Alder Lane.</li>
<li>Early in the morning, before the break of day,</li>
<li>Roger throw Nellie down beside a sack of hay.</li>
<li>Says Roger to Nellie, I'll lay your hair so deep,</li>
<li>and I'll play to you the game that they call shoot the cat with my Half-Alder Lane.</li>
<li>Three months passed and the fourth month had come.</li>
<li>The rose and Nellie's cheek, they both grew into one.</li>
<li>Her apron wouldn't tie and her corset wouldn't flap,</li>
<li>and they laid it to the game that they call shoot the cat with my Half-Alder Lane.</li>
<li>Eight months passed and the ninth month had come.</li>
<li>Born on to Nellie, your fine young son.</li>
<li>Says mistress to Nellie, We'll name him for your sake,</li>
<li>and we'll call him shoot the cat coming home from the wake with your Half-Alder Lane.</li>
<li>This young devil grew up to be a man.</li>
<li>He ran around town with his codger in his hand,</li>
<li>and every lady that he meet at her he would shake it,</li>
<li>and he said his mama shot a cat coming home from the wake with her Half-Alder Lane.</li>
<li>By God's grace, Ed, that's good.</li>
<li>This song was sung by Ed Thrasher near Round Lake, Michigan,</li>
<li>on September the 8th, 1938, by the Library of Congress.</li>
<li>The notes now will be blown on the violin, tenor, or D and G.</li>

<li>Now, are you ready?</li>
<li>I left old Germany in the year of '52.</li>
<li>When I came to this country I was feeling rather blue.</li>
<li>I had nothing to money for a meal of lettuce to buy,</li>
<li>and the only thing for me to do was root pogradine.</li>
<li>When I came to this country I went to making hay,</li>
<li>and the wages that I got were just one dollar a day.</li>
<li>I had cold supper every night, it was no use to cry.</li>
<li>I had to do the best I could to root pogradine.</li>
<li>I went to Patachia City to stay a day or two,</li>
<li>and there I met with strangers to help put me through.</li>
<li>It was there I'm playing poker where they handle a card to sly.</li>
<li>They soon had all my money, then it was root pogradine.</li>
<li>Now, I've got to stop there.</li>
<li>They took me to the courthouse next morning, just a ten,</li>
<li>and there sat a judge and a dozen other men.</li>
<li>My fine was twenty dollars, which I thought was rather high,</li>
<li>but I had to do the best I could to root pogradine.</li>
<li>Just about this time I began to repent.</li>
<li>My fine was twenty dollars and I didn't have a cent,</li>
<li>but just as luck would have it, a friend was standing by.</li>
<li>He paid me twenty dollars for to root pogradine.</li>
<li>Just about this time I began to reflect.</li>
<li>Thinking by myself, what more could I expect?</li>
<li>I thought of what my mother told me when she bid me good-bye.</li>
<li>When I left old Germany to root pogradine.</li>
<li>Pray to all you jolly bummers, pray take my advice.</li>
<li>Never go around playing, never go around playing, never go around playing.</li>
