<li>AFS recording number 2320, side A strips 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>There's a goldmine in the sky, far away. We will find it, you and I, some sweet day.</li>
<li>There'll be clover just for you, down the line. Where the skies are always blue, pal of mine.</li>
<li>Take your time, oh mule, I know you're growing late, far too faster in the stars when we strike that claim.</li>
<li>And we'll sit up there and watch the world roll by, when we find that long lost goldmine in the sky.</li>
<li>Far away, far away, we will find that long lost goldmine some sweet day.</li>
<li>And we'll say hello to friends who said goodbye, when we find that long lost goldmine in the sky.</li>
<li>Above the water, in the evening, behind the mules we walked.</li>
<li>The girl, as beautiful as the sun, was so bored.</li>
<li>Come, come, my mules, come home with me.</li>
<li>And I'll tell you my sorrows, don't tell anyone.</li>
<li>Come, come, my mules, come home with me.</li>
<li>And I'll tell you my sorrows, don't tell anyone.</li>
<li>Come, come, my mules, come home with me.</li>
<li>I've got black mules and white horses.</li>
<li>And I'm taking myself, and I'm taking myself to America.</li>
<li>I've got black mules and white horses.</li>
<li>I've found a job, I've found a job in the iron factory.</li>
<li>How I work, how I work, I take care of the work.</li>
<li>And I'm taking myself, and I'm taking myself to America.</li>
<li>I'm taking myself, I'm taking myself to America.</li>
<li>And I'm taking myself, I'm taking myself to America.</li>
<li>And young girls are taking off their wreaths.</li>
<li>Because in America, because in America, there are only unfaithful.</li>
