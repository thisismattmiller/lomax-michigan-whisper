<li>2273-A.</li>
<li>Come, all brothers sailors, I hope you're on high.</li>
<li>When you hear of the sad news, it will cause you to cry.</li>
<li>Of the noble Johnny Gallagher who sailed through and through.</li>
<li>He was lost on Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>Oh, Johnny, my dear son, in the dead of the night.</li>
<li>I awoke from a dream which gave me a fright.</li>
<li>And to Traverse City, I beseech you not to go.</li>
<li>For you'll never cross Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>Oh, mother, dear mother, though the dreams are not true.</li>
<li>I will shortly return and prove it to you.</li>
<li>Therefore the Lord will protect me wherever I go.</li>
<li>And I'll cross o'er Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>Oh, Nancy, lovely Nancy, don't stop me, my dear.</li>
<li>I will shortly return, so come dry up your tears.</li>
<li>And home in our cottage, they fall, bumpers will flow.</li>
<li>When I cross o'er Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>It was in October of '73,</li>
<li>we left Beaver Harbor and we had a concede.</li>
<li>And to Traverse City our destination to go.</li>
<li>For to cross o'er Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>We left Traverse City at nine the next day.</li>
<li>And down to Elk Rapids we then bore away.</li>
<li>We put in our stores and to see we did go.</li>
<li>For to cross o'er Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>At nine that same night a light we despised.</li>
<li>That is Beaver Island we are drawing nigh.</li>
<li>We carried all sail the lookout we did go.</li>
<li>We were crossing Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>Oh Johnny got up and he spoke to his crew.</li>
<li>He said my brave eyes now be steady and true.</li>
<li>Stand by your four hilerds let your main hilerds go.</li>
<li>There's a squall on Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>Oh said old brother Johnny the navy the navy the navy my heart soar.</li>
<li>For to think that we'll never return to the shore.</li>
<li>God help our poor parents how their tears have moved.</li>
<li>For we'll sleep in Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
<li>But I think I left out something.</li>
<li>That little couch is running before this strong gale.</li>
<li>Our rudder and ship and our board went for sails.</li>
<li>And the bellows came foaming like mountains of snow.</li>
<li>We will never cross Lake Michigan where the stormy winds blow.</li>
