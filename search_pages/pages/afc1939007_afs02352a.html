<li>[music stops]</li>
<li>Jack and Tom</li>
<li>Both had been friends</li>

<li>Short honeymoon</li>
<li>Jack returned soon</li>
<li>Meeting with Tom</li>
<li>One day</li>
<li>Come cheer up my lad</li>
<li>Why look you so sad</li>
<li>And these are</li>
<li>The words he does say</li>
<li>Oh Jack, how I envy you</li>
<li>I envy you, Jack, yes I do</li>
<li>You on her fair and square, oh man</li>
<li>And I hope you will always be true</li>
<li>I wish you good luck, oh pal</li>
<li>And here is my hand on air too</li>
<li>I was not mad</li>
<li>'Cause she loves you, my lad</li>
<li>But I envy you, Jack, yes I do</li>
<li>Happy were they</li>
<li>Jack and his wife</li>
<li>Until one fatal day</li>
<li>Though Jack was strong</li>
<li>Sickness came on</li>
<li>And took his poor life away</li>
<li>His wife had to grade</li>
<li>How she did rate</li>
<li>She didn't know what to do</li>
<li>'Til Tom came along</li>
<li>With a voice true and strong</li>
<li>Thanks, sweetheart, I'll marry you</li>
<li>Time passed on</li>
<li>Since they were with</li>
<li>Now they have children for</li>
<li>On my side</li>
<li>Baby cries night</li>
<li>Then I have to sleep on the floor</li>
<li>Tom looked back</li>
<li>Thinks of poor Jack</li>
<li>As he passes his gravy day</li>
<li>Thought says he goes by</li>
<li>With a tear in his eyes</li>
<li>And these are the words he does say</li>
<li>Oh, Jack, oh, I envy you</li>
<li>I envy you, Jack, yes I do</li>
<li>Your past all troubled and weary now</li>
<li>I'd rather replace it with you</li>
<li>How happy you must be</li>
<li>I was once happy too</li>
<li>Though you're far away</li>
<li>I'll be with you someday</li>
<li>But I envy you, Jack, yes I do</li>
<li>- Good boy, that's not good.</li>
<li>Oh, there was a big old Dutchman</li>
<li>Whose name was Otterback</li>
<li>He was very fond of food</li>
<li>But all the sour crap was mine</li>
<li>He owned a great big meat</li>
<li>Marks the knife you've ever seen</li>
<li>And his boy left it all in his chin</li>
<li>To mix all the meat by scene</li>
<li>Now it's Mr. Otterback and I thank you with me</li>
<li>And I thank you, Mr. Ray</li>
<li>You invented this machine</li>
<li>We push all the cats along to rest</li>
<li>And more to build the scene</li>
<li>So we grind 'em up and stuff</li>
<li>Please, Mr. Otterback machine</li>
<li>Oh, a little boy one day</li>
<li>Come a-walkin' in the store</li>
<li>For to buy a pound of eggs</li>
<li>He's a-walkin' on the floor</li>
<li>And while he's still pervading</li>
<li>The rest is just a film and a dog on the scene</li>
<li>Begin to walk around the room</li>
<li>Now it's Mr. Otterback and I thank you with me</li>
<li>And I thank you with me</li>
<li>You invented this machine</li>
<li>We push all the cats along to rest</li>
<li>And more to build the scene</li>
<li>So we grind 'em up and stuff</li>
<li>Please, Mr. Otterback machine</li>
<li>Oh, the machine got out of kilter</li>
<li>Somehow it wouldn't go</li>
<li>Otterback is living tight</li>
<li>For to find it out, you know</li>
<li>His wife, she had a nice mare</li>
<li>But walking in the same club</li>
<li>Crankin' hell of a yank</li>
<li>And it's Otterback with me</li>
<li>Now it's Mr. Otterback and I thank you with me</li>
<li>And I thank you, Mr. Ray</li>
<li>You invented this machine</li>
<li>We push all the cats along to rest</li>
<li>And more to build the scene</li>
<li>So we grind 'em up and stuff</li>
<li>Please, Mr. Otterback machine</li>
<li>Oh, the machine got out of kilter</li>
<li>And more to build the scene</li>
<li>So we grind 'em up and stuff</li>
<li>Please, Mr. Otterback machine</li>
