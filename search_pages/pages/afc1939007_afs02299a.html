<li>The machine is running much too fast this morning,</li>
<li>and I'm speaking my little piece here so that</li>
<li>I can gauge the frequency of the rotation</li>
<li>of the turntable a little bit better when the records are played back.</li>
<li>[no sound]</li>
<li>[ No sound ]</li>
<li>[No sound ]</li>
<li>Oh, Donald the bravest of the brave. From this world he sent a monster who is numbered with the name. And that Mason, brutal, carried to disgrace his native land.</li>
<li>Oh, Donald left his native home when he was very young to seek an honest living in the land of Washington.</li>
<li>He bids adieu to Jenny Goll, and he prayed that he might see the Saxon driven from Lafoyle and that the green flag flying free.</li>
<li>He lived beneath the stars and striped from fortune on him shone. He thought he would return again and see his native home.</li>
<li>He was shadowed by Detective Stoll, he bid his friends goodbye, and he started out to advocate his fortune for to cry.</li>
<li>She was on board of the Cannes Cool Castle from London she did sail. She was a British steamship and she carried the Cape Town Mail.</li>
<li>Among the cabin passengers there was an Irishman, all with his wife and family bound for that distant land.</li>
<li>They shook hands and made acquaintance in the real old Irish style. The stranger looked suspicious but he vainly tried to smile.</li>
<li>It was noticed he kept distant from the passengers and crew and he always tried to hide his face from everybody's view. For like Cain, when he slew Abel, he could find no place to hide.</li>
<li>He fancied vengeance followed him upon the ocean wide. And when they arrived in Cape Town, they rumored it arrived that Terry, they informer, was with them in disguise.</li>
<li>The pop then struck O'Donnell that Powers was the man and soon on board of a Melrose they faced to face to stand.</li>
<li>And the stranger he was drinking as the manor's head seemed chained and it seemed as though he got a blow that stopped his mind to rain.</li>
<li>He rushed upon O'Donnell and he swore he'd have his life.</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
