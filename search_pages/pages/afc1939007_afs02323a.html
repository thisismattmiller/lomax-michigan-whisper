<li>AFS Recording Number 2323, Side A.</li>
<li>Come all you young, shanty boys, come listen to what I say.</li>
<li>I want you to tell the story that happened on that day.</li>
<li>It was of six young shanty boys, so gallant, sea, and brave.</li>
<li>So to break the jam on Gary's rock, they met with the watery grave.</li>
<li>But it happened on a Sunday, it was in the month of May,</li>
<li>when our foreman came on to his camp, and this to us did say,</li>
<li>Turn out, my boys, turn out with your hearts so full of cheer,</li>
<li>and we'll break the jam on Gary's rock, and then for town we'll tear.</li>
<li>Oh, some of them were willing, while others they hung back.</li>
<li>To work upon a Sunday, they did not think was right,</li>
<li>but six of our bold Canadian boys did volunteer and go,</li>
<li>to break the jam on Gary's rock with their foreman, young Monroe.</li>
<li>Oh, they had not rolled off many a log, when the boss to them did say,</li>
<li>I tell you on your guard, my boys, for this jam will soon give way.</li>
<li>He hardly had those few words spoken, when the jam did break and go,</li>
<li>and carried away those six brave youths with their foreman, young Monroe.</li>
<li>Oh, the news went to the shanty, and every man turned out,</li>
<li>to search for those dead bodies to the river they drew near,</li>
<li>amongst those drifting bodies to search that grief and woe,</li>
<li>all cut and mangled on the beach by the head of young Monroe.</li>
<li>Oh, they picked up from the watery stage, and threw the grazing hares.</li>
<li>There was a form amongst them, her cries did rend the airs.</li>
<li>There was a form amongst them, a maid from Saginaw town.</li>
<li>Her mourns and cries did rend the skies, for her lover that was drowned.</li>
<li>Miss Clara was a widow, she lived by the River Bend.</li>
<li>She had a Dr. Mary, she was the raftman's friend.</li>
<li>The rest of his wages, the boss did pay to her.</li>
<li>The rest of his wages was paid.</li>
