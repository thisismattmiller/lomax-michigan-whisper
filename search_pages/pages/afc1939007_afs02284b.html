<li>2284B.</li>
<li>My parents often told me they never could control me,</li>
<li>that a weaver they would make me if I'd stay at home.</li>
<li>But I took another notion of a higher promotion</li>
<li>to try other countries as well as Rome.</li>
<li>And when I came to Nury, it was there I felt like working,</li>
<li>a charming young girl for a wife of my own.</li>
<li>But when I came to Bure, she would not endure me,</li>
<li>for off time she told me I was married at home.</li>
<li>Continually weaving, I spent that whole season</li>
<li>all thinking my true love, she would change her mind.</li>
<li>When at last I contracted, she instantly asked me,</li>
<li>What kinds are your characters from my county, Jerome?</li>
<li>It is for my character you need never ask me,</li>
<li>for my reader promised I never was too known.</li>
<li>Then she swore by her conscience that she would run all chances</li>
<li>and travel along with me to the county, Jerome.</li>
<li>Oh, early next morning as the day was adonning,</li>
<li>we took a sharp ramble down by the milestone,</li>
<li>a guard did pursue us but they could not come to us,</li>
<li>I was wishing in my heart I had her in Jerome.</li>
<li>In the great Thailand trouble our course we did double,</li>
<li>we met an old man that was walking alone,</li>
<li>he told them where he met us and where they would get us</li>
<li>and that we were still talking of the county, Jerome.</li>
<li>They came out, it was near us where the souls were lying,</li>
<li>I jumped onto one end, my case I they'd known,</li>
<li>they threw a plank to us and on shipboard they drew us</li>
<li>and told us the vessel was bound for Jerome.</li>
<li>Oh, now I am landed in my own eight of the country</li>
<li>and in spite of her parents I've got her at home.</li>
<li>Now my song for to finish she's my love, Ginny Innis,</li>
<li>and I'm old McGinnis from the county, Jerome.</li>
<li>That's the weapon.</li>
<li>You like that?</li>
<li>Oh, that's a beauty.</li>
<li>God, I don't think that's worth it.</li>
<li>You don't like it?</li>
<li>Oh, I do.</li>
<li>Remember where you learned that one?</li>
<li>I learned that from that uncle of mine, too.</li>
