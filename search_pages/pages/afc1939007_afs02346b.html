<li>AFS recording number two, three, four, six, side B, strips one and two.</li>
<li>Now the night is well spent and we have danced enough.</li>
<li>We'll spend a half an hour in giving cash for cop.</li>
<li>We'll go home to our ploughed boys, we'll whistle and we'll sing.</li>
<li>We never will get caught in such a drunken scrape again.</li>
<li>We'll go home to our ploughed boys, we'll whistle and we'll sing.</li>
<li>We never will get caught in such a drunken scrape again.</li>
<li>Now come all you old women that carry the news about.</li>
<li>Say nothing about us, we're bad enough we's out.</li>
<li>Like wise you old women that likes to make a fuss.</li>
<li>Oh you're just, just a guess, just a guess, just a guess backwards.</li>
<li>This song was sung by Herman Mars in Newbury, Michigan on September the 16th, 1938</li>
<li>for the Library of Congress in Washington.</li>
<li>Mr. Mars, will you tell us where you learned this song?</li>
<li>You learned it in Newbury? How long ago?</li>
<li>Oh 35.</li>
<li>I learned this song in Newbury, Michigan 35 years ago.</li>
<li>It's from a man by the name of Dave Devine.</li>
<li>Do you know where he learned it or where he came from?</li>
<li>No, I do not. I don't know where he came from.</li>
<li>Well the busy city washes on the sunny southern shores.</li>
<li>Steamboat came a-puffing round the bend.</li>
<li>There I left poor Dinah weeping as I saved the last farewell.</li>
<li>I'll never leave old itsy land again.</li>
<li>I said bin way down in Kansas where they told me I would find</li>
<li>money hanging up like apples on the tree.</li>
<li>But was just like Dinah told me there is nothing of the kind.</li>
<li>The weather was so cold I thought I'd freeze.</li>
<li>I'm on my way to Dinah now, hope it won't be long</li>
<li>till I see the happy face of little Ben.</li>
<li>For the way that I'm so dreary, the road that I'm so far,</li>
<li>I'll never leave old itsy land again.</li>
<li>When I see the smoke a-curling from the little Kimley top</li>
<li>and I'm mixing with the green leaves on the tree,</li>
<li>it was then I start running for I know I'd never stop</li>
<li>till I fall down by the cabin on my knees.</li>
<li>I'll thank the Lord in glory, He let me live to see</li>
<li>my Dinah and the face of little Ben.</li>
<li>For the home that I was raised in, another enough for me,</li>
<li>I'll never leave old itsy land again.</li>
<li>I learned that at the Newbury State Hospital</li>
<li>twenty years ago, a man by the name of Jim Malone.</li>
