<li>2-3-2-3, Side B, strips 1 and 2.</li>
<li>The rest of his wages, the boss to her did pay,</li>
<li>and at liberal prescription came from the boys next day.</li>
<li>Now come all you young shanty boys who travel along that way.</li>
<li>I hope you'll pay attention, I hope you'll kneel and pray.</li>
<li>I hope you'll pay attention to what cut on that hemlock tree,</li>
<li>all the day and date and his less, all the day and date and his bad fate,</li>
<li>lies your foreman, young Monroe.</li>
<li>On the Sunday morning just at the hour of ten,</li>
<li>when the tug-nicker Robert towed the spooner bigler into Lake Michigan,</li>
<li>oh, there we made our can, but in the middle of the fleet,</li>
<li>and the wind howled to the tethered boys, oh, we had to give her sheet.</li>
<li>Watch her, catch her, jump up in her juber-jew,</li>
<li>give her sheet and let her go where the lad will put her through,</li>
<li>and don't you hear it howling, oh, the wind is blowing free,</li>
<li>on our down-trip to Buffalo from Milwaukee.</li>
<li>The wind comes down from the south-south-east, it blows both stiff and strong.</li>
<li>You'd ought to see that little spooner bigler as she plowed Lake Michigan,</li>
<li>oh, Farby and her flaming bow, the fiery way to fling,</li>
<li>with every stitch of canvas and her course was wing and wing.</li>
<li>Watch her, catch her, jump up in her juber-jew,</li>
<li>give her sheet and let her go where the boys can put her through,</li>
<li>oh, don't you hear it howling, oh, the wind is blowing free,</li>
<li>on our down-trip to Buffalo from Milwaukee.</li>
<li>Passing by the foxes, the wind was blowing free,</li>
<li>sailing by the beavers with the skilligally on our lee,</li>
<li>oh, we hauled her in full and by as close as she would lie,</li>
<li>and we weathered waggish ganks and entered the straits of Mackinac.</li>
<li>Where did you learn the song?</li>
<li>Eh?</li>
<li>Where did you learn the song?</li>
<li>Where did I learn it?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Well, I learned it in United States, do you mean what country it was in?</li>
<li>No, no, what place were you in?</li>
<li>When I learned that song, I learned it on a vessel on Lake Michigan.</li>
<li>Do you remember who taught it to you?</li>
<li>Eh?</li>
<li>Who did you learn it from?</li>
<li>I think...</li>
<li>Who did you learn it from?</li>
<li>I couldn't tell you the name, you know.</li>
<li>How long ago was it?</li>
<li>Oh, that's been 40 years, 50 years ago, good 50 years ago.</li>
<li>That was about 23 or 24 years ago.</li>
<li>Did you ever see the big one?</li>
<li>Oh, many a time, yes.</li>
<li>Sooner, bigger.</li>
<li>I walked her deck.</li>
<li>I have a favorite on it, but I walked her deck.</li>
<li>No sooner, bigger.</li>
<li>Do you know how the song was composed?</li>
<li>Composed from her making this trip from Milwaukee to Buffalo.</li>
<li>And she was supposed to be the slowest vessel in the creek, see.</li>
<li>And of course, they had winds and all that, you know, and she was quite along with everything.</li>
<li>And, but the other vessels were beaters.</li>
<li>And they stopped in different places, they were supporting having a good time the last trip, you see.</li>
<li>Going below.</li>
<li>And when they got down in Lake Erie, before they got to Buffalo, they met the freaks coming back.</li>
<li>They went unloaded and come back, and come back, and come back.</li>
<li>.</li>
