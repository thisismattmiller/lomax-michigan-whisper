<li>All right, come all you jolly shanty boys that work the shanty and go.</li>
<li>Come listen to my story and I will tell to you.</li>
<li>Our trials and our hardships we undergo each day.</li>
<li>While working up in Turner's camp along the ship away.</li>
<li>I started up from Saginaw to go up the ship away.</li>
<li>I landed in a place called Clare about 11 o'clock that day.</li>
<li>The place being so stumpy, I thought I was next to hell.</li>
<li>So I jumped on board of old Saxon stage and I came to Isabel.</li>
<li>While laying around in Isabel, I thought I'd go to work.</li>
<li>Away up in the lumber camp where there was no time to shirk.</li>
<li>I started after dinnertime to take a little tramp.</li>
<li>I fetched up just a supper time to Charlie Turner's camp.</li>
<li>At 3 o'clock next morning, the cook his horn did blow.</li>
<li>For to call the boys into the hash and for the woods to go.</li>
<li>At first they put me sawing, but they found that would not pay.</li>
<li>So when the boys from Quebec left, we went to load the sleigh.</li>
<li>In loading up the dino sleigh, of course I disagreed.</li>
<li>The piling up of those top logs I never before had seen.</li>
<li>The driver being in a hurry for to get up on his route,</li>
<li>would kick the log and roll the log and shove the log about.</li>
<li>When the last load was on the sleigh to the river we would go.</li>
<li>To sing the songs of many things that happened years ago.</li>
<li>Some would sing of Johnny Troy, the others the Cumberland crew.</li>
<li>But of all the songs that I loved best was Bojack Donahue.</li>
<li>'Twas on the 16th day of May, when bright the sun did shine.</li>
<li>Our camps had gone all busted up and our men had got their time.</li>
<li>Our teams had gone all through hauling in.</li>
<li>The birds began to sing.</li>
<li>They commenced to break their loaves and I knew it must be spring.</li>
<li>One day last December, Sam Anders and me were Mount Pleasant hired to cook in the woods.</li>
<li>We hired in Mount Pleasant and took it for training.</li>
<li>We were waiting for Frank and his camp up around Bud Lake Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>We arrived at the camp on a cold stormy day.</li>
<li>The foreman he asked me how long I could stay.</li>
<li>Three months and a half I suppose we'll remain in this hotel of yours up around Bud Lake Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>Then he took me to the cook camp, he rigged me out in an old stove and two kettles, a full rig complete.</li>
<li>Oh, that was well done for we wasn't in tall vain for we had them for chock up around Hurston Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>The grub that we had to eat there was not very nice.</li>
<li>There's beds and molasses and codfish and rice, there's pork and fresh mill wool of the very coarse grain.</li>
<li>For many a mill wool's been killed up around Hurston Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>One day as Peggy stood mixing some dough, this ball had dough stuck onto him, he did say.</li>
<li>Now Peggy's not laughing, don't do that again, we're twelve days in the dungeon up around Bud Lake Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>We're twelve long great days in that hotel remain, we're twelve pounds of pork and some flour each day.</li>
<li>Until one Friday morning, my discharge came, I bid adieu to old Hurston Life, Bud Lake Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>We're twelve long great days in that hotel remain, we're twelve pounds of pork and some flour each day.</li>
<li>Until one Friday morning, my discharge came, I bid adieu to old Hurston Life, Bud Lake Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>Oh it's now to conclude and to finish my rhyme, for to sing any more boys I don't feel inclined.</li>
<li>For since I've got out, I won't go back again, for they were striped trousers up around Bud Lake Plains, Lalee Fond, Duwaiyadiwak to R'lyeh.</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
