<li>2307 A1 and A2.</li>
<li>All night Cardly winds blow, all night that never can be.</li>
<li>There are over 200 people and only five of we.</li>
<li>And if we wait we'll be too late, the battle we shall rue.</li>
<li>It's begun for me, oh Cardly dog, cried BoJack Donahoe.</li>
<li>He fought them full nine rounds before the fateful ball</li>
<li>that pierced him until the heart and caused him to fall.</li>
<li>And when he closed his struggling eyes to bid this world adieu,</li>
<li>the good people prayed for the soul of BoJack Donahoe.</li>
<li>Good, good, good, good.</li>
<li>This song was sung by Louis Brideup from Traverse City, Michigan, September the 3rd, 1938.</li>
<li>Did you ever hear tell of Long Barney?</li>
<li>He lived near the town of Killarney.</li>
<li>But a blink of his eye and the girls all would sigh, and they all fell in love with Long Barney.</li>
<li>He was going to the fair at Bing Easter.</li>
<li>His pocket did hold many a taster.</li>
<li>He met with a twig, and with her danced a jig, and they jigged it all round to Long Barney.</li>
<li>Oh, then into a tent he brought her.</li>
<li>He gave her a drop of the cracer, put his arms round her waist, and her sweet lips did taste.</li>
<li>And she cries out, Don't smother me, Barney.</li>
<li>Oh, Mr. Brian O'Darby, put your head with biddy, long as I heard.</li>
<li>Oh, it's biddy, says he, come over to me, and don't sit there listening to Barney.</li>
<li>Oh, said Barney, and you'd better toddle, or I'll give you a bell to the noddle.</li>
<li>Click-clack went the stick on the floor, Darby kicked, and they kicked him all round to Long Barney.</li>
<li>Oh, then into a tent he brought her.</li>
<li>He gave her a drop of the cracer, put his arms round her waist, and her sweet lips did taste.</li>
<li>And she cries out, Don't smother me, Barney.</li>
<li>Put his arms round her waist, and her sweet lips did taste. And she cries out, Don't smother me, Barney.</li>
<li>Oh, says Barney, there's no use resisting. My father, he's always a-listening.</li>
<li>My father and twig, says they, give a pig to a man that could marry me, Barney.</li>
<li>Oh, says Barney, and mine give another. We'll make them both sisters and brothers.</li>
<li>With Barneys and twigs, and children and pigs, we'll soon start the cabin, says Barney.</li>
<li>Was that Barney a friend of yours?</li>
<li>Yeah, he was my first cousin.</li>
<li>[laughter]</li>
<li>Where did you learn that song?</li>
<li>Well, I learned it in the camp. All in the camp.</li>
<li>All in the camp. I went to camp when I was 15 years old, and I stayed there till I was pretty near ready to die, and then I quit.</li>
<li>And then, uh, then you took another lease on life, didn't you?</li>
<li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</li>
