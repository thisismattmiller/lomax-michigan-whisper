<li>AFS Recording Number 2344, Side A, Strips 1 and 2</li>
<li>Oh, my name is Kirstel Williams and my age is 21</li>
<li>I'm a rambling wreck of poverty and a roving son of a gun</li>
<li>From driving ox-team in Comstock, Lumberwood</li>
<li>To hear me cursing, Where is Pam? It'll do your asshole good!</li>
<li>Whoa! Back, gee-haw, Diamond</li>
<li>You broad horned son of a bitch</li>
<li>It's don't you dare to kick at me or I'll slog you till you shit</li>
<li>Come, Swampert, cut that knot off</li>
<li>You lobcock son of a whore</li>
<li>Or I'll make you suck that arp out</li>
<li>Tits till your upper lip gets sore</li>
<li>For I'm like any old bullpuncher</li>
<li>I like me logger beater</li>
<li>Like any old bullpuncher</li>
<li>I take me whiskey clear</li>
<li>Like any old bullpuncher</li>
<li>I like my gin and tod</li>
<li>For I'm a rambling wreck of poverty</li>
<li>And a son of a gunby god</li>
<li>Oh, it's now I go down to</li>
<li>To bargain, I think I'm quite a man</li>
<li>I promenade around the street</li>
<li>My aleck in my hand</li>
<li>I'm going up Broadway</li>
<li>I made a pretty lass</li>
<li>I introduced her to my aleck</li>
<li>And slapped her up her ass</li>
<li>Oh, I tangled up her little guts</li>
<li>Till she went in the pit</li>
<li>And when I pulled old Ruben out</li>
<li>He was covered in blood and shit</li>
<li>For the spending from her asshole</li>
<li>Would run a water mill</li>
<li>And if you had a fatter style</li>
<li>You'd have got a barrel as well</li>
<li>For I'm like any old bullpuncher</li>
<li>I like me logger beer</li>
<li>Like any old bullpuncher</li>
<li>I take me whiskey clear</li>
<li>Like any old bullpuncher</li>
<li>I like my gin and tod</li>
<li>For I'm a rambling wreck of poverty</li>
<li>And a son of a gunby god</li>
<li>So now I go back to the woods</li>
<li>I found I got the fox</li>
<li>I wish to Christ I'd stayed at home</li>
<li>And shagged that old war fox</li>
<li>Put on a little wagon grease</li>
<li>And did it up in a rag</li>
<li>For when I think of that old horse</li>
<li>I wish I wear the tag</li>
<li>So now my song's ended</li>
<li>And I'll sing to you no more</li>
<li>So help to all you shanty boys</li>
<li>And help to that old horse</li>
<li>So now my song's ended</li>
<li>And I'll sing to you alas</li>
<li>If any of you don't like this song</li>
<li>You can kiss that off ourselves</li>
<li>Oh, there was a jolly tinker</li>
<li>He came over here from France</li>
<li>He came over to America</li>
<li>To fiddle fuck and dance</li>
<li>With his bright big limber laddy stiff</li>
<li>Standing timber-taddy red-headed</li>
<li>Wapping laddy, wapping up and down</li>
<li>Oh, he got an introduction</li>
<li>To a pretty parlor maid</li>
<li>And if you pay attention</li>
<li>I will tell you what he did</li>
<li>He screwed her in the kitchen</li>
<li>He screwed her in the hall</li>
<li>And he swore by her jump</li>
<li>He swore he'd screw them all</li>
<li>With his bright big limber laddy stiff</li>
<li>Oh, jolly tinker died</li>
<li>And of course he went to hell</li>
<li>He swore he'd fuck the devils</li>
<li>And he swore he'd fuck 'em well</li>
<li>With his bright big limber laddy stiff</li>
<li>Standing timber-taddy red-headed</li>
<li>Wapping laddy, wapping up and down</li>
<li>Oh, they put him down cellar</li>
<li>To shovel up coal</li>
<li>And he shoved the laddy's poker</li>
<li>Up the devil's asshole</li>
<li>With his bright big limber laddy stiff</li>
<li>Standing timber-taddy red-headed</li>
<li>Wapping laddy, wapping up and down</li>
<li>Another old woman at the age of 83</li>
<li>Says, By the jumping Jesus, let your tinker come to me</li>
<li>With his great big limber laddy stiff</li>
<li>Standing timber-taddy red-headed</li>
<li>Wapping laddy, wapping up and down</li>
<li>Another old woman</li>
<li>She was both deep and dumb</li>
<li>She stuck her finger up her ass and beckoned with her son</li>
<li>For his great big limber laddy stiff</li>
<li>Standing timber-taddy, limber-taddy, limber-taddy</li>
<li>Limber-taddy, limber-taddy, limber-taddy</li>
<li>Red-headed, wapping laddy</li>
<li>Wapping up and down</li>
