<li>Ring your maids from Canada, they're drunk and carry wine</li>
<li>Their main conversation was your cunts no bigger than mine</li>
<li>Oh, feelin' my holly valley, and smellin' my tiny slew</li>
<li>Doral, you're not to cross my gut to one of the holly crew</li>
<li>I first jumped up with a plumber's wife and she was dressed in green</li>
<li>And in one corner of her ruffy top top she had a limousine</li>
<li>A limousine, a limousine, a paper and a press</li>
<li>And in the other corner she had a dirty mess</li>
<li>Oh, feelin' my holly valley, and smellin' my tiny slew</li>
<li>Doral, you're not to cross my gut to one of the holly crew</li>

<li>When he saw her his old face fall, he pulled out a glove</li>
<li>That she gave him when parking as a token of love</li>
<li>And he hung on to the brass whilst they teared down his clothes</li>
<li>Oh, you are my dondo, return to them clothes</li>

<li>There was a fair young lady in Scotland, she did dwell</li>
<li>She beats the blooming roses, she's admired by all around</li>
<li>She's the charming blue-eyed chara, line of agent by the town</li>
<li>Young Henry was a highlander and a courting party came</li>
<li>And when her parents came to know they did not like the same</li>
<li>And said to see I now will go, your friend is on the frown</li>
<li>They had not been from Scotland more fancy after years</li>
<li>When hard-hearted Henry to her did lose the beard</li>
<li>He said to see I now must go, your friend is on the frown</li>
<li>And beg your way without delay to agent by the town</li>
<li>Well, pressed with grief without relief this affair made he to go</li>
<li>Until they would together fruit that on they bushes grew</li>
<li>Some people they did pity her and more did on her frown</li>
<li>And things beg your way without delay to agent by the town</li>
<li>She under a lofty shaded tree the maid sat down to cry</li>
<li>And watching all the gallant ships as they were passing by</li>
<li>She gave three cheeks for Henry and she plunged her body down</li>
<li>And away went blooming chara, line of agent by the town</li>
<li>And note likewise her bonnet she left up on the shore</li>
<li>And in the snowed a lock of hair those words I am no more</li>
<li>I am fast asleep now in the deep and the fishes watch me round</li>
<li>I was once the blue-eyed chara, line of agent by the town</li>
<li>Sons of freedom, listen to me and you doctors blend in here</li>
<li>You let Adam's cruelest story as was ever told shall be heard</li>
<li>How, you know, his troops surrendered and defenseless left the west</li>
<li>Then our forces they assembled, they invaded her too instead</li>
<li>Among those troops that marched to Erie was a king's son's volunteer</li>
<li>Captain Thomas he commanded to protect our west frontier</li>
<li>Tender was the scene at parting and mothers rang their hands and cried</li>
<li>Maidens left their wings and secret fathers tried their hearts to hide</li>
<li>There was one among that number, a tall and graceful in his name</li>
<li>For him his steps as though come daunted scarcely, no virtues was seen</li>
<li>One sweet kiss he snatched from Mary and craved his mother's prayer once more</li>
<li>Pressed his father's hand and left them, now they've gone to Erie's restore</li>
<li>And then he came with noble Perry and in that it's all the same ship to fight</li>
<li>Though his mess-mates fought around him nothing could so defy</li>
<li>But to behold him now with Perry</li>
<li>Now behold him fight with Perry and see the crimson current flow</li>
<li>Go and leave the deck to hurry, no says the bird, I will not go, here on deck</li>
<li>I took my station and never will a bird whose colors fly</li>
<li>I'll stand by the noble captain till we conquer or we die</li>
<li>Now I suffer for desertion on the brig Niagara</li>
<li>Hear my letter, brothers, sisters, his leave</li>
<li>Hear my sisters, as you hear from me</li>
