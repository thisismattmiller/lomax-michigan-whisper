<li>[Music]</li>
<li>John Henry was a man.</li>
<li>It was known for bed time.</li>
<li>He could be done without a worry thing.</li>
<li>He could line up a radio track, yes he could line up a radio track.</li>
<li>John Henry had a baby and the dress she wore was red.</li>
<li>And she walked up and down the railroad track.</li>
<li>And I'm going while my mane fell dead, yes Lord, going while my mane fell dead.</li>
<li>John Henry had a baby and he had any pain of his hands.</li>
<li>When he looked out in the yard and found a piece of steel, he said,</li>
<li>John, let that be. It's of you, yes, baby. John, let that be. It's of you.</li>
<li>[Music]</li>
<li>Now John Henry had a woman and her name was Polly Annie.</li>
<li>When John Henry laid down inside a match of death, Polly drove that steel just like a man did.</li>
<li>Drove that steel just like a man did.</li>
