<li>2274, A one and two.</li>
<li>If it wasn't for the love I have for your crew,</li>
<li>I would do unto you as I've done unto thee.</li>
<li>I would sink you in the lowland.</li>
<li>Lowland, oh, I would sink you in the lonesome sea.</li>
<li>Then he turned on his back and down went he,</li>
<li>after bidding adieu to the bold prudently,</li>
<li>as she lay on the lowland.</li>
<li>Lowland, oh, as she lay on the lonesome sea.</li>
<li>What's your name?</li>
<li>Green.</li>
<li>Day-age Green?</li>
<li>John W.</li>
<li>John W. Green.</li>
<li>And how old are you, Mr. Green?</li>
<li>Sixty-six.</li>
<li>And when did you learn the song?</li>
<li>Do you remember?</li>
<li>Oh, God, I don't know.</li>
<li>Now is it a long time?</li>
<li>I would never have thought of it, only he is.</li>
<li>Do you mind if you put me in my room or you ask me if I had it?</li>
<li>I forgot that years ago.</li>
<li>Do you know anything about him?</li>
<li>No, I don't know a thing.</li>
<li>You get that from any of them who came from the ocean, ocean sailors?</li>
<li>I know them well around there.</li>
<li>Well, do you know what war it was about or anything like that?</li>
<li>No, I don't think so.</li>
<li>Well, what did you imagine with this instrument that he used to bore this hole with?</li>
<li>An auger, it says.</li>
<li>Do you think that's possible or is it?</li>
<li>Oh, yes, I think so.</li>
<li>A lot of wind would say I'm not allowed to bore that many holes.</li>
<li>Don't you think that could be done, Dominic?</li>
<li>Don't you think that could have been done?</li>
<li>That he could run over there, swim over there to hurt with the auger and bore the holes?</li>
<li>I imagine that could be done.</li>
<li>How could you remember anything 40 years ago?</li>
<li>40 years ago, yeah.</li>
<li>How? That's an awful question to ask me.</li>
<li>I just remember it is all I know about it.</li>
<li>That's more than 40 years ago.</li>
<li>How long ago was that?</li>
<li>Well, that was in '73, and I was born in '67.</li>
<li>The way I remember, he left home with those boys that got drowned,</li>
<li>and when he got to Travis City and was ready to come back with them,</li>
<li>this old Captain Roddy had a little sailor vessel there.</li>
<li>They were good friends, and old Captain Roddy coaxed them to stay till the next day</li>
<li>and come home with him where it would be comfortable.</li>
<li>He said that it was going to storm that night and that they might not make it.</li>
<li>The old man stayed.</li>
<li>And then you heard on the island that the ship had gone down, didn't you?</li>
<li>Yeah, we heard the next morning after they were lost that this boat was lost.</li>
<li>Well, my mother knew that my father was in the boat, see,</li>
<li>because he left the harbor and went to Travis City with them,</li>
<li>and they didn't know of any other -- this Roddy being in Travis City.</li>
<li>And when the news came and the report was that all hands was lost,</li>
<li>by then that's how I remember, at the age of six years of age,</li>
<li>I remember running and hanging around Mother,</li>
<li>and I couldn't realize what they were all crying about.</li>
<li>I had six sisters, and they were all home.</li>
<li>They were all crying.</li>
<li>That night they had a wake, you know, just as though he was there.</li>
<li>And all the next day the neighbors around there come and stayed there.</li>
<li>Well, when this Captain Roddy came home the next day with this vessel,</li>
<li>and when they come to St. James Harbor,</li>
<li>they heard there that we held a wake over father at night,</li>
<li>and my father and this Captain Roddy was great friends.</li>
<li>And the father got a -- some of them got a jug of whiskey,</li>
<li>and they started home rejoicing that he didn't come in the boat that was lost.</li>
<li>And how I remember another thing, after they come home,</li>
<li>they were -- when my father came in the house, he started to dance.</li>
<li>He was always for singing and dancing when he'd get a few drinks in,</li>
<li>and he'd drink much only occasionally.</li>
<li>And I remember that he had some pies with me, for me,</li>
<li>the first pies I ever had in my life, a little cast iron shovel and a little pail.</li>
<li>And I left them in the house and run out to dig dirt with a little shovel.</li>
<li>And instead of a wake that night, they had a kind of a wedding.</li>
