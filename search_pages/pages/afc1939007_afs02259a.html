<li>We're there, you know, and there's</li>
<li>quite a bunch of us fellas, you know, maybe</li>
<li>six or seven of you in some of these camps, maybe a hundred.</li>
<li>We never sing in very awful fast, you know,</li>
<li>there's some things, you know, you can get up and sing all those songs</li>
<li>pretty fast. Now we were so, all of us, we never,</li>
<li>when I was in the woods and used to be going, the last couple of words we, when we</li>
<li>were finishing up a song, we just talked that off. I don't know, but that was really</li>
<li>pretty much up, yeah. Wherever I worked, the last couple of</li>
<li>words, we never, just talked the last, as we finished up the song, the last word,</li>
<li>we talked that off.</li>
<li>The simplest thing went up there, we just relaxed and talked that off.</li>
<li>I don't know, we always, that's the way we always got,</li>
<li>putting the other body to work around here, some brothers come off</li>
<li>different, they sing a little different, maybe not very much, but little.</li>
<li>Well how would a lumberjack sit down to make up a song?</li>
<li>How are these lumberjack songs made up?</li>
<li>Well, it's just, you're hearing one, you sing one song and one another, and then they'll</li>
<li>go out here and you know what work you do, and they make it up about the camp and work, or what work you do there,</li>
<li>or what you're doing on the river or in the woods, or if you cook,</li>
<li>or about to cook, or about the camp, or so like that, what you do.</li>
<li>And we make that up, and maybe one, it takes a couple of them</li>
<li>to make up a song sometimes, you know. Well, or the idea, no, since</li>
<li>if I sat down and tried to make one up, I'd be kind of a little monkey down, one is going to say,</li>
<li>How would you think that this would work? And he'd be thinking about the same thing, and he'd put in the words,</li>
<li>and if I thought it was all right, and did I like it, I'd say, Fine, or something like that,</li>
<li>and we'd keep on going like that until we got the song. When we got the song, sometimes</li>
<li>he wouldn't make up a song, or together, or something. I'd make up a little speech</li>
<li>about a song, and maybe I wouldn't like it, and maybe he'd</li>
<li>make up a song, and he'd like it, and we'd keep on going.</li>
<li>We got the song that we thought we'd do to sing it, and I'd say, Sing your song.</li>
<li>Why don't we sing a song? It was a nice song, we all liked it, you know.</li>
<li>Some of us tried to learn it, some of them couldn't learn it. You could sing a song a hundred times to some people,</li>
<li>and they couldn't learn it. But my day, or the day, when I was all together,</li>
<li>I ain't all here today, nor have I been since I've been stuck with the club,</li>
<li>or the car, I would say. But when I</li>
<li>used to be a young man working in the woods, up to 50 years old,</li>
<li>or 60 years old, I thought I was a young man, you know. Frankly, until I got hit,</li>
<li>I felt just like a young man. I hardly ever been sick. I hardly ever had a doctor</li>
<li>or they just, I guess I had a doctor one time, went up here to go on the drive,</li>
<li>way up in here, had one of the chipaways.</li>
<li>My father took us up, eight of us, six of us,</li>
<li>about six of us, and it was about all this team could do. We had a good team, too, to pull on the wagon,</li>
<li>take us up to two rivers. Muddy roads, you know, over in the spring of the year and early,</li>
<li>around. Lord took us, took him, well, we didn't want to walk</li>
<li>and carry our turkeys up there, and we went up there. You know, we got up there</li>
<li>and we got two rivers, and there we walked, started to walk. And it began to rain,</li>
<li>to be two of a kind. I didn't feel very well when I started and went up.</li>
<li>We took our turkey back, and my brother, when they left with us,</li>
<li>one of them was going up on the drive, and they caught him in the mine. Now, it's kind of funny about that,</li>
<li>but after we got two rivers, we went in there and they got a few drinks, you know,</li>
<li>and got a bottle to take along, and I kept telling them, I don't feel very well.</li>
<li>My brother, the foreman wanted me to go up between the grubs, and I picked him up</li>
<li>up the grub.</li>
<li>It came on dark and began to rain. Well, we had to trail through the woods.</li>
<li>I got between the mile and a quarter of the shanty. And I kept falling behind,</li>
<li>actually, you know what you're talking, I can't go no further. They pulled in, and I thought I was</li>
<li>playing off on them, you know, and they went on and left me there. God, I stayed right there all night.</li>
<li>It rained, and damn it, I had a few matches. I couldn't, I'd come right down with a typhoon</li>
<li>or malaria fever, right there. My God, I was a sick man. I'll just tell you, I couldn't hardly</li>
<li>move. Just took me in my back, and I just found there, and of course, I had good heavy clothes on it,</li>
<li>and it rained quite a little, and I mucked it down and did get some rain, and plus I made a little bit</li>
<li>of a fire and stood around that and couldn't power them up. And then the fellas went right on, you know,</li>
<li>stuck in the hell. He'll get up and come on, he can stand quite a little bit.</li>
<li>They thought, you know, that I was really drunk. I drank two drinks,</li>
<li>but, you know, I wasn't drunk, I was sick. I kept telling them I was sick, you know, and they</li>
<li>thought too. Oh, he'll show up and come on, you know. But God, they got on up there and kept waiting</li>
<li>for me, and when they got in there, they didn't know which way the hell they'd come in, you know, dark,</li>
<li>and it was up in there before, and they got up at the camp. God, I stayed there the morning.</li>
<li>Well, it kind of quit raining, but I mucked around, kicked around, kept getting them old dry brush,</li>
<li>and kept that fire going a little bit, but I couldn't lay down, but oh, boy, there I was.</li>
<li>Pretty quick, I heard a rooster crow about before, just a little while before daylight.</li>
<li>It was shining right about a quarter of a mile from where I was.</li>
<li>Old feller lived over there, him and an old woman.</li>
<li>And I'd never been up to on that trail before to go over to this, where the camp was,</li>
<li>where they were going to start from there, where they had the camp. And so I, you know,</li>
<li>darn it, I heard this rooster crow, and I just started out in that direction.</li>
<li>Every little while I'd hear that rooster crow. God, I couldn't hardly walk. Oh, boy, I was sick.</li>
<li>Oh, boy, just with this type of armillarity, boy, I was off of bed.</li>
<li>Well, I got over to that place at last. I guess I was an hour going a quarter of a mile.</li>
<li>I said, The old man, the old woman, the old man was out.</li>
<li>First I seen this woman. He was out behind taking care of a pair of yoke cattle he had there.</li>
<li>And then he came in just a minute, but he said, Just come right in.</li>
<li>I told her I was off a sick man, and could we get a doctor or something.</li>
<li>She said, There's a doctor out there, too, that was right up.</li>
<li>We'd come through there, I guess, that's only a ways back, about two miles and a half from there.</li>
<li>And my father went on home, you know, and got us there, and my brother and cousin</li>
<li>and the rest of the crowd went right on up there and got him with them fellows there.</li>
<li>Monty Brown had a drink to give them and forgot all about me, you see.</li>
<li>He said he'll be long in a minute, a rough kind of, you know, rough stature.</li>
<li>I said, Yeah, I'll have to have a doctor.</li>
<li>Well, this woman, the first thing she's done, she just came right in, her husband came in,</li>
<li>and they put a mustard plaster on me.</li>
<li>She said, You've got some kind of a fever.</li>
<li>She seemed to be a kind of an old doctor herself, like.</li>
<li>Oh my, they're awful good old people, but they're poor, you know.</li>
<li>Well, she had some mustard there, and she put on a real good mustard plaster on me.</li>
<li>My God, but put down pretty hard, you know, it burnt me.</li>
<li>The skin off me was pretty bad. Well, I went out and got that doctor,</li>
<li>and he comes and says, You're an awful sick man.</li>
<li>You'd better get to Mount Pleasant. You've got the type 4 malaria fever.</li>
<li>He better ask me where I live, and I told him, I'm not an awful sick man.</li>
<li>He said, You bet you are. Your fever is awful high.</li>
<li>And I've done it. It's happened to me.</li>
<li>But if you can get down, work down here, too, when you come back here,</li>
<li>and you see anybody there, you can get anybody to Two Rivers, to the hotel there.</li>
<li>Before you, you'd just have to come to Two Rivers.</li>
<li>There used to be a couple of stores there, and livery barns, and everything.</li>
<li>And so this fellow, a fellow by the name of Herb Churchill, he's a Harley fellow.</li>
<li>He used to be their father. He used to run a livery stable here.</li>
<li>And he drove up their team with a load of fellows to take them up there to the drive, you see.</li>
<li>So this doctor, when he went back, he just happened to see him.</li>
<li>And he just said, Here, you just drive right down here and get this fellow.</li>
<li>He's an awful sick boy, and he wants to go to Mount Pleasant.</li>
<li>Well, I knew him. He knew me just 'cause he told me my name.</li>
<li>Well, he went right down and got me there to that place and took me right to the safe home.</li>
<li>Well, then he sent for our doctor here in Mount Pleasant.</li>
<li>He's a doctor before the eyes out of my head.</li>
<li>He took a little bit of a cold with this here, and it was 21 days this fever was on, you see.</li>
<li>Practically, I just scared the hell out of time.</li>
<li>I thought, My God, I'm right through a big cave and it's going right down in there 100,000 feet.</li>
<li>That scared me, you know.</li>
<li>When I'd think, I'd just jump right up out of bed, you know, kind of cruelly like, you know.</li>
<li>I took much pain with that.</li>
<li>But I got over that.</li>
<li>Now, that's only the one sickness, really, to say sickness that I've ever had in all my life.</li>
<li>I've always been lucky.</li>
<li>At least I got this clip, you know, this hard crack here.</li>
<li>I've been hurt a little time, quite a lot of times.</li>
<li>I've been struck, as I told you last night, with that skid there, not down 40 feet, you know.</li>
<li>If I'd had one of them logs, I wouldn't have been here to tell the tale, you see.</li>
<li>But anything that kind are struck on hard.</li>
<li>How?</li>
<li>What did you say, here?</li>
<li>Well, as we build up these old ways, as we cross the river, as I told you,</li>
<li>I guess you put them in there like that.</li>
<li>[The End]</li>
