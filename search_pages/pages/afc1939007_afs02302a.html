<li>2302A1 and 2.</li>
<li>What all is to our domestic? See, there is a secret still That only say all earth knows and hears.</li>
<li>There's none but them can tell. Now we care not, you may laugh at us,</li>
<li>Who's safe in harbor key. But ne'er will he forget us, God who dwells upon the deep.</li>
<li>For a moment and his dwelling place in a sailor's grave may be.</li>
<li>But never do I once regret when first I went to sea.</li>
<li>You've got a very popular song here on the island.</li>
<li>Well, it's a popular song in each place, indeed.</li>
<li>Yes, I tell you, it originated, I tell you, first.</li>
<li>First one was a fellow by the name of Salted Lines, sang it national.</li>
<li>Down by the name of Salted Lines.</li>
<li>He was an old shell, an old sailor, an old saltwater sailor.</li>
<li>Good singer, too. I never heard of him, but that's where first originated from,</li>
<li>and came to this conference from.</li>
<li>It's a present of mine.</li>
<li>Just play it over again. I'll see that's right.</li>
<li>Daddy McCarty, a sweet Irish lad, he came from the county of Ballinafide.</li>
<li>Where he spent his young days until man he had grown, he come to this country a few years ago.</li>
<li>Where he settled alone quite innately, fate good luck attended him greatly.</li>
<li>The one thing that bakes him completely was in the want of a cow to give milk.</li>
<li>So then he consulted his wife Peggy Ann, an eight-little girl from the county coven.</li>
<li>She said that her milk she must have anyhow, so Pardew went out for to buy her a cow.</li>
<li>Two by one he struck out so gaily, whirling his black horn so laily.</li>
<li>He met with old farmer Bailey, a Protestant Yankee so cute.</li>
<li>They hankered around and a wagon soon made the price of the cow for the farmer pat pay.</li>
<li>Singing along the way, sir, as he drew home his newly bought cow.</li>
<li>He arrived at the gate, Peggy Ann at the door, such an elegant creature she'd never seen before.</li>
<li>Did you get her, said Peggy so gaily, to see sure I bought her from old farmer Bailey.</li>
<li>From that Protestant thief blood and thunder, oh Pat, she's a Protestant cow.</li>
<li>Never mind that, go into the house and mind what you're at.</li>
<li>A bottle of holy water bring out to me now, and I will soon make her a cattle of cow.</li>
<li>A bottle of blue bitter she brought out instead, so Pat began pouring it on the cow's head.</li>
<li>Make him sign it across as he pours, all in a sudden the cow let her roar.</li>
<li>[applause]</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
