<li>2281 B 1 & 2.</li>
<li>When in zero old Ireland I did well, I lived here on my own.</li>
<li>And my parents, they were poor, I own and kind portions, sit on them and frown.</li>
<li>And our father had a very small but rent and taxes high, and it did compel me by doing that lovely made of oil.</li>
<li>And there was a merchant doctor near our mother's eyes, and I was very poor, I own and she wished to be my bride.</li>
<li>And when she heard her eyes going away, she frowned her hands and cried, Oh Johnny, don't you cross the sea.</li>
<li>And I said, My dear Eliza, if you will come with me.</li>
<li>And before we go to Ireland, my dear, we will be.</li>
<li>And for your sake I will venture where the Atlantic below roars.</li>
<li>And we'll have a giant after this when we're in Baltimore.</li>
<li>And early the next morning, just by the break of the day, I started on a journey with my Eliza again.</li>
<li>So my darling, she was the most coldly to behold, and in her belt a fortune sold five hundred thousand gold.</li>
<li>And straight to Belfast we could go for to join in the black band, and when we converse together great happiness we found.</li>
<li>Our passage was paid down in full, we were bound for Baltimore, and we did good-bye to all our friends on the lovely Shannog's shore.</li>
<li>And we bought a little farm and we cleared the way, and with my good highlander labor I soon was richly paid.</li>
<li>And I wrote a letter to Ireland and this to them it said, If my father-in-law was not content, I would pay him back his chain.</li>
<li>And he wrote me back an answer and this to me it said, Five hundred more you will have from me on your young son's birthday.</li>
<li>And I wish you many a happiness and that you may prosper well, although you brought my darling child in a foreign land as well.</li>
<li>My name is Edward Holland as you may understand, and I was born in Waterford in Erin's happy land.</li>
<li>And I was young and in my prime, and beauty did on me smile, and my parents doted on me for I was their only child.</li>
<li>And my father bound me to a tray in Waterford's fair town, and he bound me to a cooper by the name of William Brown.</li>
<li>And I served that master faithfully for eighteen months or more, and I shipped on board of the Ocean Queen down the far belt of Fraser's shore.</li>
<li>On the fly in the clouds as a Spanish ship she carried five hundred tons or more, and she could easily sail around any craft going out of Baltimore.</li>
<li>And her sails were as white as the driven snow and on them not a speck, and twenty-five nine pounder guns she carried on her deck.</li>
<li>On the fly in the clouds the clippers that carried five hundred tons or more, and she could easily sail around any craft going out of Baltimore.</li>
<li>I have often watched that gal ship with the wind blowing about her beam with her oil and stumpsail shuttled off taking eighteen of the reels.</li>
<li>And in less than three weeks sailing we reached the African shore, and five hundred of those natives sailed from their native home we bore.</li>
<li>And we marked them out up on a plank and we shoved them down below, carefully eighteen inches to a man we had all that we could stow.</li>
<li>And then we thought to see my bice with our cara above slave, and it would have been better for those poor soldiers if they were in their graves.</li>
<li>For a plague and fever then started and swept them half away, and we hiked their dead bodies on deck and we throw them to the sea.</li>
<li>Then, in less than three weeks sailing, we reached the Belfast shore, and we sold them out to planters to be slaves forevermore.</li>
<li>They rice and coffee fields to sow beneath a biling sun, far to trial and labor all their days until their carterier was run.</li>
<li>And when our money had was lost then we thought to see again, and Captain Moore he came on deck and said unto his men,</li>
<li>There is gold and silver to be had if with me you remain. We will heist aloft that pirate flag and we'll scour the Hispanic name.</li>
<li>We all agreed but five young youths who asked us for some land, and the two of them were Boston boys and two from Newfoundland.</li>
<li>And the other was an Irish chap belonging to Timor, and I wished to God I left the ship and went with them on shore.</li>
<li>And we robbed and plundered many a ship down on the Spanish main, which leaves the widows and poor orphans in sorrow to remain.</li>
<li>Oh, we marched them out upon a plank, stole them a lot of regrains, and the saying of our captain was, A dead man has no tales.</li>
<li>And pursued were we by many ships where they cannon rolled around, but it was all in vain for them to catch the flying clouds.</li>
<li>When a British ship and a man of war the dungeon pulled in view, and she fired a shot across our bow, and it did melt to heat too.</li>
<li>And we never let out a heater, but we set the force to rewind, and a broad shot struck our men in the mouth, and then we fell behind.</li>
<li>We cleared our deck for action as she came up alongside, and there across our quarter deck there ran a crimson tide.</li>
<li>We fought 'til the captain Moore was shot, and he of his men and a bunch of us set our ship on fire, and we all ducked across the land, across the land.</li>
