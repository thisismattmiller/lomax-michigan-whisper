<li>James Derry's Prayer.</li>
<li>As I went a-walking for treasure right of Rome to the oaths that James Derry to spend</li>
<li>evening and afternoon, as I sat there and waited to pick up a tree, the night is a-spicing</li>
<li>and nature's a-seeing.</li>
<li>I sat there and listened to hear what he said.</li>
<li>Now, my sweetest jewel, I screwed you before, I screwed you before, but I screwed you before,</li>
<li>but I now screw you here, and it was down on her back, this fair damsel that lay, and</li>
<li>he knelt down beside her and began to pray, O most amorous queen, lend ear to my prayers.</li>
<li>This snowy white belly, this glossy brown hair, I come to this juicy fountain of love,</li>
<li>'Tis a heavenly blessing sent down from above, O most amorous queen, grant me fall here on</li>
<li>my knees, that all those crumpled innuendos may soon find relief.</li>
<li>By a jock he exclaimed from his knees in his racket, and he slapped Adam's dire between</li>
<li>her white thighs, her movements were graceful, every movement he met, my feelings, I was</li>
<li>up in the tree, and I had a wet, I couldn't help laughing, there's polypathy, and Christ</li>
<li>how they scooted from under my tree.</li>
<li>Party on the wedding bells.</li>
<li>While the whole house bells were ringing and a man stood at the door, he had an awful hard</li>
<li>time, he wanted to skin a whore, he took his twice, went up to bed, and then pulled off</li>
<li>his clothes, he asked her if she'd suck him off and blow it to her nose, Oh, I can't</li>
<li>do that, the old man said, and his face was full of snuff, I'd like to suffer just a</li>
<li>bit, but the blowing that's too tough, but I'll tell you again, we both can play, but</li>
<li>if you want me to, if you get down and suck me off, then I will suck you too.</li>
<li>While the whole house bells were ringing and those two were up in bed, wondering which</li>
<li>would get their gun off first, into the other's head, they would stop and think a moment,</li>
<li>then they'd give an awful start, just another load of kite face blown into a rotten fart.</li>
<li>She then got up and took a towel and wiped his asshole clean, she swore he had the sweetest</li>
<li>breath that ever she had seen, not a ding or dong, oh, could she find, to save her rotten</li>
<li>soul.</li>
<li>She then got up and stuck her tongue right up his old asshole, Oh, try and sit a little</li>
<li>bit, go please me if you do, and if you've got the diarrhea, just drop me a kidney stew,</li>
<li>I can't do that, the old man said, and his eyes began to shine, but turn around the</li>
<li>other way and we'll talk some other time.</li>
