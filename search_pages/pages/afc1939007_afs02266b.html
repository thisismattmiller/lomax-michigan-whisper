<li>2266, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>Come all you sons of freedom, and listen to my theme.</li>
<li>Come all you roving lumberjacks that run the Saginaw stream.</li>
<li>We'll cross the Tidibewati where the mighty waters flow.</li>
<li>And we'll roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>And once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>We will roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>When the white frost hits the valley and the snow conceals the woods,</li>
<li>the lumberjack has enough to do to find his family food.</li>
<li>No time he has for pleasure or to hunt the buck and doe.</li>
<li>He will roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>And once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>We will roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>With our cross-cut saws and axes we will make the woods resound.</li>
<li>And many a tall and stately tree will come crashing to the ground.</li>
<li>With camp hooks on our shoulders to our boots that's deep in snow.</li>
<li>We will roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>And once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>We will roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>You may talk about your farms, your houses and fine places,</li>
<li>but pity not the shanty boys while dashing on their sleigh.</li>
<li>For around a good campfire at night we'll sing while wild winds blow.</li>
<li>And we'll roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>And once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>We will roam the wild woods over and once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>Then when navigation opens and the water runs so free.</li>
<li>We'll drive our logs to Saginaw once more our girls to see.</li>
<li>They will all be there to welcome us and our hearts in rapture flow.</li>
<li>We will stay with them through summer then once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>And once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>We will stay with them through summer then once more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>When our youthful days are ended and our stories are growing old.</li>
<li>We'll take to us each man a wife and settle on the farm.</li>
<li>We'll have enough to eat and drink contented we will go.</li>
<li>We will tell our wives of our hard times and no more a lumbering go and no more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>We will tell our wives of our hard times and no more a lumbering go.</li>
<li>That was brought in here by Miss Roeck or Becker one of them when we were going to get ready to go to St. Louis for our first National Folk Festival.</li>
<li>You don't know where they got it?</li>
<li>No I don't.</li>
<li>I understood though it comes from Midland.</li>
