<li>23.06 a 1 & 2.</li>
<li>When we get into Quebec, Blay boys, we won't forget.</li>
<li>We're so far too wet with some whiskey or good wine.</li>
<li>With some pretty girl we'll boast till our money it kills all you.</li>
<li>Then, Blay boys, we won't refuse for to go and fall to find.</li>
<li>With some pretty girl we'll boast till our money it kills all you.</li>
<li>Then, Blay boys, we won't refuse for to go and fall to find.</li>
<li>What's the name of the song?</li>
<li>Well, it's Fall to Find.</li>
<li>Song of the Find.</li>
<li>Yeah, Song of the Find.</li>
<li>Where'd you learn it, do you remember?</li>
<li>Oh, in the lumber camp.</li>
<li>How long ago?</li>
<li>Oh, that must be 40, 45 years ago.</li>
<li>Remember the name of the man that sung it?</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>Oh, the song of the song?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Well, no, I don't.</li>
<li>I heard Dominion.</li>
<li>The song was sung by Lester Wells in Travis City, September the 3rd, 1938.</li>
<li>As I went a-walking one evening of late When Florelle's gay mantle the fields decorate</li>
<li>I carelessly wandered where I did not know By the banks of a fountain that lies in Glencoe</li>
<li>Like her who the prize of Mount Idy had won There approached me a lassie as bright as the sun</li>
<li>The ribbons and tartans around her did flow That once graced MacDonald, the pride of Glencoe</li>
<li>I thought she was enchanted to her I do not</li>
<li>The red rose and lily on her cheek seemed to vie I asked her her name and how far she'd to go</li>
<li>She answered me, Kind sir, I am bound for Glencoe</li>
<li>Sad I, my dear lassie, your enchanting smile And calmly sweet features does my heart be guile</li>
<li>And if your affections haunt me you'll be stow You'll bless the happy hour we met in Glencoe</li>
<li>Young man, she made answer your suit I disdain For I once had a sweetheart, young MacDonald, by name</li>
<li>He went to the war about ten years ago And a maid I'll remain till he returns to Glencoe</li>
<li>Perhaps young MacDonald regards not your name But has placed his affections upon some foreign dame</li>
<li>And may have forgotten for what that you know The lovely young lassie he left in Glencoe</li>
<li>My MacDonald's true valour when tried on the field Like his gallant ancestors disdaining to yield</li>
<li>The Spaniards and French he will soon overthrow And in splendour return to my arms in Glencoe</li>
<li>The power of the French is hard to pull down And causes many heroes to die of their wounds</li>
<li>And with young MacDonald it may happen so The man you love dearly perhaps is laid low</li>
<li>My Donald from his promise can never depart For love, truth, and honour are found in his heart</li>
<li>And if I never see him still single I'd go And mourn for my Donald the pride of Glencoe</li>
