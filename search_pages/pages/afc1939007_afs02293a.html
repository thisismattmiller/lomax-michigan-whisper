<li>2293A</li>
<li>As I walked out to Derby I met the other day</li>
<li>one of the finest rams, sir, that ever I would see</li>
<li>with my Calreale and my Calreale</li>
<li>he was one of the finest rams, sir, that ever your eyes would see</li>
<li>he had four feet to stand on and four more to gang on</li>
<li>and every one of them they would cover an acre of rams</li>
<li>with my Calreale and my Calreale</li>
<li>he was one of the finest rams, sir, that ever my eyes would see</li>
<li>the ram was fat behind and the ram was fat before</li>
<li>and the ram was ten years old and I'm sure he was no more</li>
<li>with my Calreale and my Calreale</li>
<li>he was one of the finest rams, sir, that ever my eyes would see</li>
<li>they farmed upon this ram</li>
<li>they grew so mighty high</li>
<li>that every time he rattled them they would rattle against the sky</li>
<li>with my Calreale and my Calreale</li>
<li>he was one of the finest rams, sir, that ever my eyes would see</li>
<li>now the man that owned this ram, I am sure he was not poor</li>
<li>but the man that composed the song was a lion son of a whore</li>
<li>and my Calreale, Calreale, Calreale</li>
<li>now, Roddy, you should think about that</li>
<li>there was nothing in there about the man that lifted the lamb in the flood, wasn't there?</li>
<li>what about the hair up on this ram's back?</li>
<li>it grew so mighty high that the swallow was built on it and the young one dared not fly</li>
<li>and what about his tail?</li>
<li>the one I heard about his tail was the one that grew so very long that he would lay down on his tail</li>
<li>and every time he rattled his tail it rumbled that poor house down</li>
<li>yeah, I guess that's the man</li>
<li>oh, hell, I didn't think of that before</li>
<li>the man has gone to France</li>
<li>the nigger old man has gone to France</li>
<li>and that's the last of my old man</li>
<li>what about that jack of your boots ball? how did it begin again?</li>
<li>there was a project in the well</li>
<li>yeah, he's dead now</li>
<li>well, he had another song</li>
<li>do you ever hear of Willie O?</li>
<li>you've heard of him, haven't you?</li>
<li>my dad used to sing it</li>
<li>oh, I've heard of a fellow that died and left his sweetheart behind and then he came back for it when he was dead</li>
<li>oh, come, all of you young men and maidens</li>
<li>then listen to me for to sing a song</li>
<li>and it's all concerning my co-lover</li>
<li>and he's gone to serve the king</li>
<li>and he has gone on board of a tender</li>
<li>to someplace that I don't know</li>
<li>and that may heaven above protect my darling and send to me my Willie O</li>
<li>well, however</li>
<li>what happened?</li>
<li>he came back, he got grounded and then he came back to earth</li>
<li>do you remember the last song?</li>
<li>yeah, I think I do</li>
<li>I think you could go ahead and sing it all over again</li>
<li>oh, I don't think I could do that</li>
<li>and when he came back she said</li>
<li>and Willie dear, where are those blushers?</li>
<li>you used to wear a long time ago</li>
<li>and he said</li>
<li>and I'll ask to a deathless king of the colors</li>
<li>but I'm your Willie, you don't know</li>
<li>and when she saw him disappearing</li>
<li>down on her knees she fell so low</li>
<li>oh, Willie dear, tender</li>
<li>oh, Mary dear, tender hearted jewel</li>
<li>I'm the ghost of your ego</li>
<li>what was that kind of a thing?</li>
<li>well, I'm listening to some other songs about ghosts</li>
<li>there's one about a young man that gets married to a girl</li>
<li>he doesn't want her to marry him for money</li>
<li>and then he dies and that's a violent act</li>
<li>well, he comes to a bed sheet and says</li>
<li>how do you like your bed sheets?</li>
<li>how do you like your sheets?</li>
<li>how do you like your pretty fair maid?</li>
<li>how do you like your bed sheets?</li>
<li>do you remember that?</li>
<li>well, was that like the July 11th song?</li>
<li>how did that go?</li>
<li>well, he said he came for the wedding</li>
<li>was that one?</li>
<li>he came for her wedding and all that</li>
<li>this is a ghost song</li>
<li>well, did you ever hear the girl I left behind?</li>
<li>no</li>
<li>well, put that on there if you want to hear it</li>
<li>the parents reared me tenderly</li>
<li>they had no child but me</li>
<li>and my mind was bent on rambling</li>
<li>and with them could not agree</li>
<li>and my mind was bent on sailing</li>
<li>and it did weep my heartful soul</li>
<li>and I left my aged parents</li>
<li>that I never hoped for peace no more</li>
<li>then to Dumford, a town I next sailed down that</li>
<li>a place I thought we went</li>
<li>and handsome Janey Ferguson</li>
<li>so I'm wrong there</li>
<li>well, I have to start with the beginning of the news</li>
<li>my parents reared me tenderly</li>
<li>and they had no child but me</li>
<li>and my mind was bent on rambling</li>
<li>and with them could not agree</li>
<li>and I became a rover soon which did weep my heartful soul</li>
<li>and I left my aged parents</li>
<li>and I will never see them all</li>
<li>there was a wealthy gentleman that lived off in that part</li>
<li>and he had an only daughter and I had to gain her heart</li>
<li>this maid was noble minded, a child, beautiful and fair</li>
<li>with Columbia's only daughter she really could compare</li>
<li>and I told her my intention was for her to cross the main</li>
<li>and I asked her if she approved sincere till I returned again</li>
<li>and great drops of tears fell from her eyes and her abode kept aside</li>
<li>Dear you, said she, fear not for me, my love will never die</li>
<li>and according to agreement I went on aboard the ship</li>
<li>and to the town of Glasgow I had a pleasant trip</li>
<li>so the people they were good to me and they were good and kind</li>
<li>and my love began to cool for that girl right behind me</li>
<li>(fire crackling)</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
