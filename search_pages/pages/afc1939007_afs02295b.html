<li>In the winter when the snow drifted through again the starry cabin door, Kate Maloney,</li>
<li>wife of Patrick, lay night dying on the floor, lay on rags of tethered garment, moaning out with</li>
<li>feeble breath, kneel beside me, Pat, my darling, pray the Lord to give me death, and pat he knelt</li>
<li>down beside her, took her pin and wasted hand, saying something to her softly which she sure</li>
<li>could understand, there's one hundred golden guineas at my mercy, if you will, don't you know</li>
<li>that Mickey Reagan's in that hut up on the hill, come beside me, hear you crater, kneel beside me,</li>
<li>and now swear that here now are the hereafter that you will never dare to even write a single</li>
<li>letter breathing Mickey Reagan's name, I would die of cold and famine, but I would not die of</li>
<li>shame, while late that night when Kate was dozing Pat craft cautiously away, from the cabin to the</li>
<li>hobel where poor Mickey Reagan lay, he was there, he heard him breathing, something whispered to him</li>
<li>go, the land claimed a hundred guineas, Kate will never need to know, he would tell some little</li>
<li>story to his wife when he got home, he would say the priest had met him and had sent her wine and</li>
<li>meat, and no one passed that lonely cabin that Kate would lay in fancy still, and for Pat he</li>
<li>crept away in secret from that hut up on the hill, while Kate awoke at Mr. Husband's guest</li>
<li>as they're in, as they're in, that my curse may be upon you with a curse of God and men, from her</li>
<li>side she slowly staggered, took her husband's loaded gun, oh my God, I pray thee help me ere</li>
<li>that traitors deed be done, and she went on to the doorstep and the wind was blowing fast, and she</li>
<li>saw her husband coming against the winter's blast, once she called him but he heard not, neither gave</li>
<li>he glance behind, and her wife was weak and feeble and it fainted on the line, but she took the gun</li>
<li>and fired and her life was falling fast, and poor Mickey he fell down dead against that winter's</li>
<li>blast, now no child unborn will curse you or your country, loathe your name, I have saved you,</li>
<li>oh my husband, from a deathless deed of shame, and those who live to guess that story poor Mickey</li>
<li>Reagan got away, and across the broad Atlantic lives an honest man today, but in God we still</li>
<li>may hasten, mark that lonely mountainside where an Irish man was martyred and an Irish woman died.</li>
