<li>Now I want every man in church to get up and testify tonight</li>
<li>and tell just what you think and what you feel and how you feel about Jesus.</li>
<li>Tell us just how you know that Jesus died for you.</li>
<li>All right, Sister Lowdown, come on over there, you.</li>
<li>You talking to me? Yes, I'm talking to you, Sister Lowdown.</li>
<li>And tell us what did Jesus do to you.</li>
<li>Well, brother and sister, I know that Jesus died for me.</li>
<li>The reason I know that I've been changed because one Thursday morning</li>
<li>I felt a change and a renewedness.</li>
<li>And I know my Redeemer lived because he lived out in my soul.</li>
<li>And I want all of the saints here to join me in singing this song</li>
<li>that I know my Redeemer lived.</li>
<li>And brothers and sisters, I don't have no desire to sin</li>
<li>because there's no sin or no condemnation for whatever in my life.</li>
<li>So I want you all to join me in this one song.</li>
<li>[music]</li>
<li>Now, saints, I'm up before you tonight to testify to a living Christ.</li>
<li>I know that Jesus Christ has healed my body and I know he is a healer</li>
<li>because he healed me when I was in my bed, when I was sick,</li>
<li>and everyone had given me out.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ come into my body and healed my body.</li>
<li>So I know he's a healer.</li>
<li>That's the reason I can set this song so good.</li>
<li>[music]</li>
<li>Now we're going to end our meeting and come to a conclusion.</li>
<li>Now we all have testified to the name of the living Christ.</li>
<li>And we ask in all the saints and brothers everywhere</li>
<li>to pray that we'll grow stronger and that we'll not turn backward.</li>
<li>We'll press forward and be the lady of the name that God has called us.</li>
<li>Amen.</li>
