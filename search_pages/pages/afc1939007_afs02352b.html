<li>Now if you'll only stop, then we'll just get up your yacht</li>
<li>I'll relate to you a story of a trim</li>
<li>He was not the kind of shirt</li>
<li>He was looking hard for work</li>
<li>But he heard that same old story everywhere</li>
<li>Tram, tram, tram, keep on a trampy</li>
<li>Nothing doing here for you</li>
<li>If I catch you here again</li>
<li>You will wear the ball and chain</li>
<li>Just keep tramping, that's the best thing you can do</li>
<li>Up the street he met a cop</li>
<li>And the cop he made him stop</li>
<li>And he said, So when did you blow into town?</li>
<li>So came up before the judge</li>
<li>Brought the judge, he said, Oh, but</li>
<li>Tramp that has no money needn't hang around</li>
<li>Tram, tram, tram, keep on a trampy</li>
<li>Nothing doing here for you</li>
<li>If I catch you here again</li>
<li>You will wear the ball and chain</li>
<li>Just keep tramping, that's the best thing you can do</li>
<li>He walked up and down the street</li>
<li>Seeking something for to eat</li>
<li>Any spider maiden cooking chicken stew</li>
<li>He says, How do you do?</li>
<li>May I split that wood for you?</li>
<li>What this lady said, it made him feel so blue</li>
<li>Tram, tram, tram, keep on a trampy</li>
<li>Nothing doing here for you</li>
<li>If I catch you here again</li>
<li>You will wear the ball and chain</li>
<li>Just keep tramping, that's the best thing you can do</li>
<li>Where did you learn this song?</li>
<li>Huh?</li>
<li>Where did you learn it?</li>
<li>I got this from the same guy that I got the mother's song from, a nephew of mine</li>
<li>What's his name?</li>
<li>Earl Pettis</li>
<li>He sings too?</li>
<li>Yeah, but he's in Washington, he's pretty hard to hear</li>
<li>Washington state?</li>
<li>Yeah, he's...</li>
<li>Washington state, Elmore Washington</li>
<li>Elmore Washington</li>
<li>What's his number?</li>
<li>Well, it's the back then off the draft line</li>
<li>Earl Pettis, Elmore Washington, yeah</li>
<li>Now, but you're saying the next time</li>
<li>That's the song that Bart made after the group?</li>
<li>Oh, I bought me a wife in the middle of June</li>
<li>Nickety, nickety, now, now, now</li>
<li>I took her home with a light of the moon</li>
<li>With a high-billy Wally and Johnny Bang Doodle</li>
<li>And Sandy O'Rossico, now, now, now</li>
<li>Oh, I bought a couple cows and they were good</li>
<li>Nickety, nickety, now, now, now</li>
<li>I told her to milk whatever she could</li>
<li>With a high-billy Wally and Johnny Bang Doodle</li>
<li>And Sandy O'Rossico, now, now, now</li>
<li>Oh, she milked her cow in a dirty old crop</li>
<li>Nickety, nickety, now, now, now</li>
<li>And she trained her milk through a dirty old sock</li>
<li>With a high-billy Wally and Johnny Bang Doodle</li>
<li>And Sandy O'Rossico, now, now, now</li>
<li>Oh, she churned her milk in a dirty old boot</li>
<li>Nickety, nickety, now, now, now</li>
<li>She churned her dashers, she used her old foot</li>
<li>With a high-billy Wally and Johnny Bang Doodle</li>
