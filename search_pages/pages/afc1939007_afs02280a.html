<li>2280, A1 and 2.</li>
<li>On a cold winter night as the campus was snarling</li>
<li>the snow like a sheet, the bird cabins died</li>
<li>and Barney went over the hills to his darling</li>
<li>and tapped at the window for Kotlin to cry.</li>
<li>And a curseless said, Are you asleep or awake?</li>
<li>The night's bitter or cold and my coat it is thin.</li>
<li>The storm is brewing, the frost it is baking.</li>
<li>Oh Kotlin, my Barney, won't you let me in?</li>
<li>Oh Barney, said she, and she spoke to the window.</li>
<li>And would you be taking me out of my bed?</li>
<li>For to come out this hour to the shame and it's thin too.</li>
<li>It's whiskey not love that got into your head.</li>
<li>If your heart it was true of my fame you'd be tender.</li>
<li>Consider the time and there's a nobody in.</li>
<li>And a lot has a poor girl but her name to defend her.</li>
<li>Oh Barney, my Barney, I won't let you in.</li>
<li>Oh a curseless said he'd take your heart up the fountain.</li>
<li>I would weep for the wrongs I might lay at your door.</li>
<li>Your name is more pure than the snow on the mountain.</li>
<li>And Barney would die to preserve it as pure.</li>
<li>I will go to my cot though the winter winds face me.</li>
<li>I will whistle them off for I'm happy with them.</li>
<li>For the name of my Kotlin will comfort and bless me.</li>
<li>Oh Barney, my Barney, I won't let you in.</li>
<li>[laughter]</li>
<li>When I was a bachelor area young and I followed the rolling trade.</li>
<li>And the only harm that ever I done I courted a pretty fair maid.</li>
<li>I courted her in the winter season and part of the summer too.</li>
<li>But I never found out my true love to mine till I rolled her in the foggy dew.</li>
<li>One night as I lay on my bed pretending for to sleep.</li>
<li>I overheard a pretty fair maid most grievously did weep with the ringing of her hands.</li>
<li>Oh she says what shall I do?</li>
<li>Oh get out of the bed my pretty little maid and get into the foggy dew.</li>
<li>Oh the very first quarter of that year there's a maid that grew pale and thin.</li>
<li>And the very next quarter of that year her dress that would not pin.</li>
<li>And the very first quarter of that year she bore to me a son.</li>
<li>And now you can see as well as me what the foggy dew has done.</li>
<li>I courted her, I loved her and I made her my lawful wife.</li>
<li>I never will cast it up to her.</li>
<li>No duh, no duh, no duh, no duh, no darn be a boo.</li>
<li>But every time the little one smiles I think of the foggy dew.</li>
