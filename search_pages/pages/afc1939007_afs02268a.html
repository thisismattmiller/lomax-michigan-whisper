<li>2268 A1 and 2.</li>
<li>This couple then got married, and happily now they're married.</li>
<li>It should be nice when they go to bed, and till his arms he crawls.</li>
<li>He'll take her by the slender waist, and roll her to the wall.</li>
<li>There was a rich merchant in London, and well he had but one daughter, a beautiful girl.</li>
<li>She was adored by rich lords dukes, but she slideth in model.</li>
<li>She dearly loved her sailor, he was handsome and tall.</li>
<li>As the lady was walking in her garden one day, she met her cruel father, and those words he did say.</li>
<li>Can't you find no better young man your arms to embrace, than to marry a sailor your friends to disgrace?</li>
<li>Father, dear father, your pardon I crave. My sailor is willing, he's the lad I adore.</li>
<li>And I mean to go with him, for the loud millows roar.</li>
<li>Daughter, dear daughter, since it fell to your lot, for to marry a sailor I'll hinder you not.</li>
<li>You may do things in private, and think not of me.</li>
<li>And when you are married, we'll fondly await.</li>
<li>As the lady and the sailor came to their church doors,</li>
<li>A press gang surrounded about half a store. They tore him from her arms and sent him away, and instead of good work proved a sorrowful day.</li>
<li>She dressed herself up in a suit of men's clothes.</li>
<li>She bargained with the captain, and it fell to her lot, to lie in her lover's arms, but he knew it not.</li>
<li>As the lady and the sailor was crossing the beach, said the lady to the sailor, you sighed in your sleep.</li>
<li>I once had a true love the sailor did say, but by her cruel parents they sent me away.</li>
<li>I am an astronomer, I've been rushed to my tent, and an astronomer books I for rose now and then.</li>
<li>Come tell me your age, and I'll trace up your lot. I'll see if you'll gain her, your true love or not.</li>
<li>My age is eighteen from the hour of my birth.</li>
<li>She said you were born then for a great guy at Mary's.</li>
<li>She said as she smiled I am greatly surprised to see you don't know me, although in disguise.</li>
<li>This couple got married on a Monday ship's crew. They are now living happy, contented and true.</li>
<li>Her father would give hundreds and thousands in store to see the fair face of his daughter once more.</li>
<li>Well not too bad, only that's right.</li>
<li>What's your name?</li>
<li>Don McAllagher.</li>
<li>And how old are you?</li>
<li>Seventy-one, passed.</li>
<li>And where were you born?</li>
<li>Aver Island. And where did you learn this song? I learned that song about...</li>
