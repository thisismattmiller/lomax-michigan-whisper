<li>2283, A 1, 2 and 3.</li>
<li>We are the boys for diversion and diplomats.</li>
<li>For we are the boys for diversion and diplomats.</li>
<li>Dancing and singing and all other joys.</li>
<li>Eruption, destruction, diversion and diplomats.</li>
<li>And who to be compared to, very wonderful boys.</li>
<li>All young men and the simple, and they only do so here.</li>
<li>It is only a poor, unfortunate lad.</li>
<li>He was a noble foreigner.</li>
<li>And his parents raised him tenderly, not many miles from here.</li>
<li>In the township of RKD in Lake County, Albuquerque.</li>
<li>Over stands a little shingle mill.</li>
<li>It had scarcely run one year.</li>
<li>It was where this trouble indeed was done.</li>
<li>Caused many to weep out and wail.</li>
<li>It was where this young man lost his life, his name was Harry Bale.</li>
<li>On the 29th of August, at the same time of year.</li>
<li>He went to work as usual, no danger did he fear.</li>
<li>By the flipping of the feed bar, which they carried into a gear.</li>
<li>It pulled him out upon the saw.</li>
<li>And it cut him so severe.</li>
<li>He was then thrown out upon the saw.</li>
<li>But they carried him coming back.</li>
<li>It cut him through the shoulder, a blade and a part way down the back.</li>
<li>He started for the shanty, but his life was failing fast.</li>
<li>He said, My boys, I'm wounded. I hear it. It is my last.</li>
<li>The doctors, they were sent for and his mother came also.</li>
<li>And the doctors tried to heal his wounds, but that was not true.</li>
<li>No sisters had for Harry to weep beside his bed.</li>
<li>Nor can her loving father, as they both were dead.</li>
<li>He lingered on one day and night, and that's what he was saying.</li>
<li>Hushed is his life forever, he will never speak again.</li>
<li>And the springtime, it will come again to greet this wild domain.</li>
<li>And the little birds in the breezy flowers will sweetly sing again.</li>
<li>And the fond love that they gave to him.</li>
<li>And all the fond love they could give was planting weeks of flowers around Harry's grave.</li>
<li>That's Harry Bale.</li>
<li>I don't know if you learned that in the long war somewhere, but I think you're going along well out there.</li>
<li>It was just before the last discharge to go to the ruins plain.</li>
<li>With a touch of the hand and a parting word was never to meet again.</li>
<li>One had blue eyes and curly hair nineteen months a month ago.</li>
<li>And a red and a rosy was his name, he was only a boy you know.</li>
<li>And the other was tall, dark, stern, and proud, what a state of the world was in him.</li>
<li>And he trusted more to the cares of this world, who was always more dear to him.</li>
<li>And they marched together for many a race, they rode together for many a range, and marched for many a mile.</li>
<li>On to that last stop over there was a calm and a hopeful smile. And the tall, dark man was the first to speak.</li>
<li>He said, Charlie, my hour has come. Now we both will ride up to the crystal of that hill.</li>
<li>But you will ride back alone. And if you ride back and I am the left, will you do the same for me?</li>
<li>For I've got a mother to hear the news, news, news, and her tenderly.</li>
<li>There is a fair face on my breast, and I'll wear it in the fight.</li>
<li>She had bright blue eyes and sunny curls, and her smile was like the morning light.</li>
<li>And the morning light was like joy to me, she had a wonderful life.</li>
<li>It was little that I thought of the frowns of this world, and she promised to be my wife.</li>
<li>Well then, they argued, came to march, and comrade, and comrade the rest, and I will do your bedding, comrade, comrade, comrade, ride back alone.</li>
<li>But if you ride back and I am the left, will you do the same for me?</li>
<li>For I've got a mother to hear the news, and ride to her tenderly.</li>
<li>One after another, although she loved, she buried a husband and a son.</li>
<li>And I was the last that her country called, and she cured and sent me on. And she prays at home like a weeping saint, her pale face wet with woe.</li>
<li>Oh, her heart will be broken when I am gone. I pray for her children, I know.</li>
<li>Well then, they argued, came to march, and comrade, and comrade the rest, and I will do your bedding, comrade, comrade, comrade, ride back alone.</li>
