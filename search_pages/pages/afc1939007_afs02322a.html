<li>AFS recording number 2322, side A, strips 1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>One morning in April, by the dawn of the day, my gun in good order o'er the hills I did</li>
<li>stray.</li>
<li>Just some game if the weather proved fair, determined to fire on pure bunny black hair.</li>
<li>I met a fair dandelion fair as the rose, her dress as white as the lily that grows, her</li>
<li>hair hung in ringlets and her shoulders were bare.</li>
<li>I asked her if she'd seen my bunny black hair, said she.</li>
<li>I met a fair dandelion fair as the rose, her dress as white as the lily that grows, her</li>
<li>hair hung in ringlets and her shoulders were bare.</li>
<li>I asked her if she'd seen my bunny black hair, said she.</li>
<li>She answered and her answer was no, but in under my apron they say it does grow.</li>
<li>Since you have deceived me, deceived me so fair, we'll go down to the green grove for</li>
<li>your bunny black hair.</li>
<li>So down to the green grove determined was I.</li>
<li>I met this fair dandelion, I laid this fair dandelion down on the green grass.</li>
<li>I loaded my rifle and placed the balls there, determined to fire on at her bunny black hair.</li>
<li>Said she, your powder is sweet and your bullets are fair, I wish you'd fire on at my bunny</li>
<li>black hair.</li>
<li>My powder is spent and the bullets all gone, my ramrod is limber and I cannot fire on.</li>
<li>I'll see you next Saturday if the weather proves fair and then I'll take a broad smash at your</li>
<li>bunny black hair.</li>
<li>My old mother is a fine old lady, if you want to lie with her you must be sure that the lala's</li>
<li>sleeping to rye-de-dem-a to rye-e-le, to rye-de-dem-a one night rye-lein.</li>
<li>I went upstairs and who could I meet, nobody else but Kitty Norrie, got her by the gills</li>
<li>of the ass.</li>
<li>Send old Ruben home to glory, to rye-de-dem-a, to rye-e-le, to rye-de-dem-a one night rye-lein.</li>
<li>I went upstairs and who could I meet, nobody else but her old father, la the pistol by</li>
<li>his side, shoot the man that shagged his daughter, to rye-de-dem-a to rye-e-le, to rye-de-dem-a</li>
<li>one night rye-lein.</li>
<li>I got the old man by the throat, poked his head in a pail of water, shoved the pistols</li>
<li>up his ass, shagged his wife as well as his daughter, to rye-de-dem-a to rye-e-le, to rye-de-dem-a</li>
<li>one night rye-lein.</li>
<li>I took my prick, get old, old dog Couser, chased him three times round the house and spucked</li>
<li>the hole where he went and under, to rye-de-dem-a to rye-e-le, to rye-de-dem-a one night rye-lein.</li>
<li>That's all I know.</li>
