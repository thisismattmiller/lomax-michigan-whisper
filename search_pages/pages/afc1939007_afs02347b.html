<li>Come, all you young companions, and listen unto me.</li>
<li>I'll tell you all a sad story of some bad company.</li>
<li>I was born in Tensters, England, among a beautiful hill,</li>
<li>and the memories of my childhood is worn within me still.</li>
<li>I did not like my father, I did not like my own.</li>
<li>I had my mind on rambling, oh, far away did roam.</li>
<li>I had a kind old mother who often would plead with me,</li>
<li>and the last wish that he gave me was a prayer to God for me.</li>
<li>I had two loving sisters, as sweet and kind as we used to be,</li>
<li>and on their knees before me they prayed and wept for me.</li>
<li>I bid adieu to loved ones, to whom I bid farewell.</li>
<li>I landed in Chicago, the very depths of hell, 'twas there I took to drinking.</li>
<li>I've seen both night and day, and yet within my boots is the peace</li>
<li>those boys would say, Oh, fare you well, my loved ones.</li>
<li>May God protect my boy, and the blessings ever be with him,</li>
<li>to what his man put joy. I quoted a fair young maiden whose name I did not tell,</li>
<li>as I would never disgrace her, as I am doomed for hell, 'twas on one April's evening.</li>
<li>The stars were shining bright, and with that fatal daggers I took away her life,</li>
<li>and now I'm on the scaffold. My moments are not long, as the...</li>
<li>and now I'm on the scaffold. My moments are not long.</li>
<li>You may forget the singers, but don't forget the song.</li>
<li>But I learnt that about twelve years ago.</li>
<li>I don't remember the man's name. I just heard him sing this night, aren't I?</li>
