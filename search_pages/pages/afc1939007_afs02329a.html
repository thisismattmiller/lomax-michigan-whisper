<li>I say, when they built those cars, manufactured those cars in the United States and built those great pavements through the world, through the United States and all the world,</li>
<li>it made more hoards than it ever was before in the United States.</li>
<li>How did that happen?</li>
<li>Well, because they used to have whorehouses them days, you know, here and there and all over, you know, they'd have a whorehouse away from the city.</li>
<li>The boys used to go there, see, understand, to the whorehouses, and a decent girl could walk the street anytime and never be insulted.</li>
<li>Now they can't, see.</li>
<li>And now the whorehouses, they would have barred them all out and take them out of these cars, see.</li>
<li>Well, the girls will go out now and they'll stop you, give us a ride, give me a ride, see.</li>
<li>The girls nowadays don't want to be insulted, they want to insult you.</li>
<li>Years ago, when I remember, now when I was a young fellow, years ago, why, if a girl would stop a man with a horse and buggy on the street and tell him to give her a ride, that would be a dirty insult, you see.</li>
<li>Oh, they think that is awful.</li>
<li>You see, you know, I'll tell you something, you know.</li>
<li>I was in Wisconsin, living in Wisconsin, and I was a young man, you know, and I was fishing there.</li>
<li>And my brother had a horse and buggy.</li>
<li>I was fishing with him.</li>
<li>I went to a farmer's daughter one night, I knew her, Christ, I knew her, what dance was it, and all that.</li>
<li>I went there one afternoon, I went in the evening, I went in the evening, I went in the evening, to get her for a buggy ride.</li>
<li>And she was willing to go, and she had to ask her father and mother, see.</li>
<li>And she asked him, Yes, you can go, but you've got to take Johnny with you.</li>
<li>I was a little boy, see.</li>
<li>A little boy about ten years old, a little bit older, something like that.</li>
<li>He's got to go with you.</li>
<li>You think you could get a girl out some days alone in your buggy?</li>
<li>Not by a God damn sight.</li>
<li>You've got to take Johnny with you, or Jimmy, whoever his name is.</li>
<li>Well, that's because it was them days, eh?</li>
<li>Let's have that song about Jack now.</li>
<li>All right.</li>
<li>Already?</li>
<li>When, when poor Jack, he came on shore, with his gold and money and stowers,</li>
<li>he was led like a horse by the altar,</li>
<li>with Bertie Polly by his side, with a dark and a rolling eye, he's contented to the heart like all sailors.</li>
<li>The landlady then comes in, she is dressed both knit and trimmed,</li>
<li>she appears like some evening star, for to welcome poor Jack in,</li>
<li>when she finds him in good trim, chocks him down, for to one at the bar.</li>
<li>Then this game was flat carried on, until Jack's money was all gone,</li>
<li>not a kind word to be spoken or be heard, with her nasty snarling eye and her nose turned towards the sky,</li>
<li>saying it's time you young sailor to be going.</li>
<li>Then poor Jack, he makes no reply, but a canter he lets fly.</li>
<li>Oh, it's at this old woman in the rage, and the daughters that wear a fright,</li>
<li>call the watchman of the night, oh, bundle this young sailor to the quay.</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
