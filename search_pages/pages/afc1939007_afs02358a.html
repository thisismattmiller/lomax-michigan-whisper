<li>I am a bold rapman from Greenville, I came.</li>
<li>My name is engraved on the rocks of St. Shore.</li>
<li>From house top to bar shop, I'm very well known.</li>
<li>They call me Jack Haggerty of Flat River town.</li>
<li>Me occupation is a river man for the White Water's role.</li>
<li>My departure and departure at last I defend.</li>
<li>The dark blots of Cubie has caused me much grief.</li>
<li>My heart struck with a thunder and I can near get relief.</li>
<li>My troubles I'll tell to you without much delay.</li>
<li>A sweet little lassie my heart stole away.</li>
<li>She was the blacksmith's daughter on Flat River's side.</li>
<li>I always intended to make her my bride.</li>
<li>I dressed her in jewels and the finest of lace.</li>
<li>The costest of muslin to her I embrace.</li>
<li>I gave to her my wages for her to keep safe.</li>
<li>And begrudged her of nothing that I had on this earth.</li>
<li>Till one day on the river a letter I received.</li>
<li>And she said from her promise herself she'd</li>
<li>relieve to be married to another who had long been delayed.</li>
<li>And that the next time I saw her she would never be a maid.</li>
<li>To her old mother Jane Tucker I laid all the blame.</li>
<li>She caused her to forsake me and darken my name.</li>
<li>And to cast off the rigging which God would soon tie.</li>
<li>And it's left me to wander along the Flat River's side.</li>
<li>Then the two to Flat River for me there's no rest.</li>
<li>I will shoulder my PV and I will go well.</li>
<li>I will go to Muskegon, some pleasure to find.</li>
<li>And leave my own Annie, my true lover, behind.</li>
<li>So it's come all you bold river man with the heart stout and true.</li>
<li>Never depend on a woman your beat if you do.</li>
<li>And if ever you meet one with the dark chestnut curl.</li>
<li>Just think of Jack Hagerty and his flat river girl.</li>
<li>Where did you learn that?</li>
<li>Oh, I learned that at home when I was a boy down in lower Michigan.</li>
<li>Used to hear my father sing it.</li>
<li>Joseph D. Norman.</li>
<li>Well, just the same as myself.</li>
<li>Around where he's working, he'd be asked to sing, take a drink or two.</li>
<li>Oh yes, he used to sing a number of songs.</li>
<li>Not a Policeman is one.</li>
<li>Not a Policeman, that's an old song.</li>
<li>My father used to sing, Jack Donahoe.</li>
<li>No, he never did.</li>
<li>I don't sing any of those either.</li>
<li>No, I don't remember of his ever singing.</li>
