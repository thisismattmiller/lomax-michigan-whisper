<li>2276B</li>
<li>It was on a Christmas evening as I lay down to sleep.</li>
<li>I heard a boy of six years old on his mother's kneaded wheat.</li>
<li>Saying once I had a father dear who did me kind embrace.</li>
<li>And if he was here he would write those tears down my mother's face.</li>
<li>Oh, where is that tall and gallant ship that first bore him away?</li>
<li>With tops of socks and painted eggs borne by the breeze away.</li>
<li>While other ships are coming in splitting the white sea foam.</li>
<li>Oh, why don't my father's ship come in and why don't he come home?</li>
<li>Oh dear son your father has tarried for to cross the stormy sea.</li>
<li>The ocean and the heark and sweet sea will never come back to thee.</li>
<li>Dear father, dear son your father's dead and gone to the home of the brave.</li>
<li>The stormy ocean and winter winds we tore your father to grave.</li>
<li>Oh, well do I remember when he took me on his knee.</li>
<li>And gave me all the fruits he bore from off that India tree.</li>
<li>He said six months he would be gone and here leave us alone.</li>
<li>But by those stormy winter winds twelve months are past and gone.</li>
<li>Oh, hush my garthing little son your innocent wife is gone.</li>
<li>Now you and I are all that's left for two of them to mourn.</li>
<li>You are the garthing of my heart I will press you to my side.</li>
<li>As the rose does rise to heaven and the sun has other skies.</li>
<li>And for all that I hold in the Indians I will not have heard it again.</li>
<li>There was a young lady who lived by the riverside.</li>
<li>She was proper, tall and handsome and they said it and they cried.</li>
<li>There was a brave young sailor, young Mary's heart had gained.</li>
<li>And she moved through to Henry whilst on the raging main.</li>
<li>It wasn't Henry's absence a wealthy lark there came.</li>
<li>All for to court pretty Mary but she refused the same.</li>
<li>Oh, my vows are gained for on the main this maiden she replied.</li>
<li>There for be gone a love but one and he's on to reside.</li>
<li>Then, add with desperation this heartless man did say.</li>
<li>For to prove your separation I will take your life away.</li>
<li>And I'll watch you late and early till you're all alone he cried.</li>
<li>And I'll send your body sinking down on the hill every time.</li>
<li>And it was about three weeks after she walked out to take the air.</li>
<li>Down down by the rolling ocean she met that young man.</li>
<li>Consent, I'll send this heartless man.</li>
<li>Consent and be my bride.</li>
<li>Or I'll send your, send your, send your.</li>
