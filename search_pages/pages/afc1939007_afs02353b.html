<li>2353, B1 and 2.</li>
<li>Come all you true boys from the river,</li>
<li>Come and listen to me for a while,</li>
<li>And I will relate to the story,</li>
<li>Of my true friend and chum Johnny Stiles.</li>
<li>We were camped on the wild mustard river,</li>
<li>Down by the old reservoir dam.</li>
<li>When two of our one mourners,</li>
<li>We rode from our blanket,</li>
<li>On the rocks there we spied a big jam.</li>
<li>As soon as we'd eaten our breakfast,</li>
<li>We pulled for the head of the dam,</li>
<li>While two of our boys took the pole trail,</li>
<li>For to flood from the reservoir dam.</li>
<li>The water came rocking and howling,</li>
<li>With PVs and pike poles we pried.</li>
<li>Till at last we gained faith in the middle,</li>
<li>And like rightlings from there he did fly.</li>
<li>While riding her into dead water,</li>
<li>His foot it got caught in a jam.</li>
<li>He never once squealed till an under,</li>
<li>For he always had plenty of sand.</li>
<li>Five hours we worked at hard labor,</li>
<li>Till the sweat from our brow it did pour.</li>
<li>We dragged his dead body from an under,</li>
<li>But it didn't look like Johnny anymore.</li>
<li>He would crunch from his heels to his middle,</li>
<li>And his head was cut off in the jam.</li>
<li>We buried him down by the river,</li>
<li>For the larks and the whipper will sing.</li>
<li>Where's your last name gone?</li>
<li>My dad.</li>
<li>Jack died.</li>
<li>I could die.</li>
<li>How old are you?</li>
<li>Thirteen.</li>
<li>Were you born in Canada?</li>
<li>Born in Ottawa.</li>
<li>Where are you from?</li>
<li>Canada.</li>
<li>What's that?</li>
<li>I don't know what kind of thing it is.</li>
<li>Have you been to a lot of bums out there?</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>If you all will close your traps,</li>
<li>I will tell you about a chap</li>
<li>Who was broken up against the two for fair.</li>
<li>He was not the kind to jerk,</li>
<li>He was looking hard for work,</li>
<li>But he heard the same old story everywhere.</li>
<li>Cramp, cramp, cramp, keep on a tramping,</li>
<li>Nothing doing here for you.</li>
<li>If I catch you on the game,</li>
<li>You shall wear the ball and chain,</li>
<li>So it's tramping is the best thing you can do.</li>
<li>He walked up and down the street,</li>
<li>Still his shoes were off his feet,</li>
<li>'Til at last he found a lady cooking stew.</li>
<li>And he said, How do you do?</li>
<li>Can I split some wood for you?</li>
<li>What the lady told him made him feel so blue.</li>
<li>Cramp, cramp, cramp, keep on a tramping,</li>
<li>Nothing doing here for you.</li>
<li>If I catch you on the game,</li>
<li>You shall wear the ball and chain,</li>
<li>So it's tramping is the best thing you can do.</li>
