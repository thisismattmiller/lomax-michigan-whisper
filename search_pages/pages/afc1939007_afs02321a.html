<li>AFS recording number two, three, two, one, side A, strips one, two, three, and four.</li>
<li>In New York City where I did well, they sold your boy, and they sold your boy, and they sold your boy, and they sold your boy.</li>
<li>In New York City where I did well, they sold your boy, and he loved so well, he called at me in my hearty way, and with me now he would not stay.</li>
<li>There is a house in Yonderstown where my love goes and he will sit down. He takes a strange girl upon his knee, he tells her things that he won't tell me.</li>
<li>Oh grief, oh grief, I'll tell you why, she has more gold and silver than I. Her gold will rust, her silver will fly, she'll ruin the day just as poor as I.</li>
<li>When I wore my purse low, he followed me to frost and snow, and now I'm aware not too much, and he passed the door and he never looked in.</li>
<li>Go and get me a chair and set me down, a penny nink to write it down, and every line she'd drop a tear, calling back her willy dear.</li>
<li>Her father came as to the door, he saw her hanging up on a rope, he took his knife and he cut her down, in her bosom these lines were found.</li>
<li>Going deep mid-grave, both wide and deep, a marble stone at her head and feet, upon my breast a turtle dove, to show this world I died for love. God damn my voice tremble, I hate it, I'm cold in hell.</li>
<li>This song was recorded near Round Lake, Michigan in Emmett County on September the 8th, 1938 by Mr. Adolphus Delmas, 77-year-old resident, former resident of Crossville, Michigan, who now lives in Mackinac City.</li>
<li>The notes now be blown on the violin tuner, or D and G.</li>
<li>Eight foot, straw foot, and a foot at all, Jenny lost her middy, had to go to the wall, she lost it in the weeds and she found it in the grass, she wrapped it up in a rag, and she put it up her friend's hand.</li>
<li>That's all.</li>
<li>Got it ready now? Tell them it's French.</li>
<li>That's flamed, that's rusted, that's flamed right up.</li>
<li>Pray come all ye old bummers, pray take my advice, never go around playing poker, nor going around shaking dice, for sure as you're born you'll take too much old rye, and they'll slap you in the calabooster, root, hog, or die.</li>
