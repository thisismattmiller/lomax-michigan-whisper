<li>A.F.S. Duplication Project tape number 150, side B. This is A.F.S. recording number 2330,</li>
<li>A, strips 1 and 2. Oh, dear, it's home, and it's home, my love to thee. Oh, dear, it's home,</li>
<li>in my own country, where the ash and the oak and the bunny birch trees, they're all a-growing</li>
<li>green in this North America. Oh, if it is a boy, oh, if it is a girl, she will stay at home with me.</li>
<li>If it is a boy, he will plow the raging sea with his tarpaulin hat and his roundabouts of blue.</li>
<li>He will pace the quartered deck as his daddy used to do.</li>
<li>You want all over it? All over it? Oh, yes, because you didn't have it on then.</li>
<li>The sixth and seventh and eighth of April, 1862, oh, General Grant, with his brave crew,</li>
<li>made a glorious stand for the Union, right-handers, dine-ay, right-el-o-day, right-handers, dine-ay,</li>
<li>right-el-o-day. Oh, General Grant, with his brave crew, made a glorious stand for the Union,</li>
<li>all night we lie on the damp cold ground, no tent, no shelter could be found, until the rain had almost</li>
<li>drowned, then we cheered our hikes for Cairo. The Badger boys in their blue coats are now behind us,</li>
<li>may suppose, but the Bally face the southerner foes, but we'll Bally face the southerner foes,</li>
<li>and we'll gain the heights of Cairo. The First Corred, the southerners led, they left their wounded</li>
<li>and their dead, but I am sure the river run red with the blood it was spilt at Cairo.</li>
<li>And I am sure the river run red with the blood it was spilt at Cairo.</li>
<li>Where did you learn that song?</li>
<li>I learned it by hearing old soldiers that come back from the Civil War.</li>
<li>They, they, they sung it, I heard them sing it, different ones.</li>
<li>But you were a little boy.</li>
<li>I was only, well, yes, I must have been, you see, I was born in '62, and my father went to the war,</li>
<li>he listened and went to the war when I was two months old.</li>
