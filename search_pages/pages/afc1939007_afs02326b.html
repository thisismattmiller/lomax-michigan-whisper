<li>2-3-2-6, Side-B.</li>
<li>For six long years, and Bedman left his land.</li>
<li>He returned home with fortune and pain.</li>
<li>Oh, he landed at his cottage on Hudson's fair shore.</li>
<li>He said, I will not leave this. I leave it no more.</li>
<li>Oh, the thoughts of his Mary still ring through his mind.</li>
<li>I will go, and my true love I will find.</li>
<li>Oh, he sought her in vain. He sought her with care.</li>
<li>But alone had she wandered. Only God knows where.</li>
<li>One day as he was residing on the banks of the Green,</li>
<li>where the small bird did whistle so sweetly did sing,</li>
<li>Oh, the sun was declining, and the evening grew near,</li>
<li>when the voice of his Mary enchanted his ears.</li>
<li>Oh, he saw her residing in the shades of those trees,</li>
<li>where the small bird did whistle and the notes of the breeze.</li>
<li>Oh, her cheeks had grown pale, though she was fair as the sun,</li>
<li>and those worthy actions that fell from her tongue.</li>
<li>Oh, pity kind heaven, and to my sad heart,</li>
<li>I was a doom from my Edwin to part.</li>
<li>Oh, long had he sailed from my old native shore.</li>
<li>He fixed my sad doom to behold it no more.</li>
<li>If he could been a doom in some graveyard near home,</li>
<li>with pleasure, enjoyment, so happy I would roam,</li>
<li>with the finest of laurel I'd twine around his beard.</li>
<li>I'd moisten cold clay with one affectionate warm tear.</li>
<li>Oh, if he could perhaps he has drowned in some ocean's wide waves,</li>
<li>where thousands have met with a watery grave,</li>
<li>or else he is laying on some far distant land,</li>
<li>where his deathbed was sued by no true love one can.</li>
<li>Oh, Edwin his feelings no more could control.</li>
<li>He lay from his ambush and see her, her, her, her.</li>
