<li>This song was composed on the burning mills at Fall River.</li>
<li>In this wild world of saddles and troubles, many accidents occur.</li>
<li>I will sing to you the saddest, the saddest you have heard.</li>
<li>Was in Fall River City, where people were burned and killed.</li>
<li>In a factory or a prison, none as the granite mills.</li>
<li>At seven o'clock the fire bell rang, but at last it was too late.</li>
<li>For the fire was a-reaching, and at a fearful rate.</li>
<li>There were men and women in it, and children, I suppose.</li>
<li>Had the truth been known, they might all have been saved from the flames of the burning mills.</li>
<li>The first sight was a terrible one, a girl so young in years.</li>
<li>She was standing in a window, and her eyes did bathe with tears.</li>
<li>She was standing in a window, hey, calling her mother's name.</li>
<li>Crying, Mother, Mother, save me! And she fell back in the flame.</li>
<li>Her whole soul has gone to rest, and away in heaven shall go.</li>
<li>Away, away in heaven, and away from the burning mills.</li>
<li>The next sight was a richer one, and a sight within my eyes.</li>
<li>They were jumping from the six stories high, and sliding from roofs so high.</li>
<li>And one poor soul thought he would escape by sliding down a rope.</li>
<li>But as he got about halfway down, the fire strength burned the rope.</li>
<li>Scritch, scritch came down the poor soul, burned bruised and chilled.</li>
<li>And the ropes came tumbling down in the flames of the burning mills.</li>
<li>'Tis now to conclude and finish my song, and I hope you'll all agree.</li>
<li>That I've tried to please you one and all in this large company.</li>
<li>And it is my opinion I tell you, and it is my opinion still.</li>
<li>If the truth had been known, they might all have been saved from the flames of the burning mills.</li>
<li>And Paul River and your team, what was it about?</li>
<li>I can't remember.</li>
<li>Why don't you remember yourself?</li>
<li>I don't remember why you learned the song.</li>
<li>I learned the song, oh Jesus, when I was nothing but a kid a champion here.</li>
<li>I learned that song a champion here, who in the hell did I...</li>
<li>I believe you learned that from Mike, Mike what the hell was his name?</li>
<li>His brother was a...</li>
<li>Oh, maybe yes, I didn't tell him who was singing it on the radio, on the...</li>
<li>This is Fred Carrier singing this song, that's all I wanted to tell him.</li>
