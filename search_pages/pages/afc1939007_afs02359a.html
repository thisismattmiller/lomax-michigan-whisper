<li>[PAUSE]</li>
<li>There was a wild Colonian boy, Jack Dolan was his name.</li>
<li>He was born in Dublin City, not so far from Castle Main.</li>
<li>He was his mother's pride and joy.</li>
<li>Yes, he was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy.</li>
<li>And dearly did those parents love their wild Colonian boy.</li>
<li>At the early age of 16 years, he started his wild career.</li>
<li>His courage being undewanted, no danger did he fear.</li>
<li>He robbed the rich to help the poor.</li>
<li>He stabbed Don McElroy, who trembling, gave his gold up</li>
<li>to this wild Colonian boy.</li>
<li>At the early age of 18 years, he left his happy home.</li>
<li>And through Australia's happy land, he were inclined to roam.</li>
<li>He robbed the wealthy squire, their farm he did destroy.</li>
<li>A tarrier to Australia was this wild Colonian boy.</li>
<li>One day across the prairie, as Jackie rolled along,</li>
<li>listening to the mockingbird as they sang their evening song.</li>
<li>He spied three mounted policemen, Skelly, Daisy, and Fitzroy.</li>
<li>They were called out to capture him, the wild Colonian boy.</li>
<li>Surrender now, Jack's darling, you see they're three to one.</li>
<li>We arrest you in the queen's name, for you're a plundering son.</li>
<li>He drew a pistol from his side, made to them this reply.</li>
<li>I'll fight, but never surrender, said the wild Colonian boy.</li>
<li>He fired a shot at Skelly, which fetched him to the ground.</li>
<li>While a shot from Daisy's pistol, he received a fatal wound.</li>
<li>When a bullet pierced his brave young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy.</li>
<li>And that's the way they captured him, this wild Colonian boy.</li>
<li>Do you know where that came from?</li>
<li>No sir, I do not.</li>
<li>I heard it years and years ago, way back, working around the camp somewhere.</li>
<li>Then a brother of mine used to think it, pick it up from here.</li>
<li>He worked in the woods a year ahead of me, I believe.</li>
<li>Did you have any off days to do this?</li>
<li>Not to work in the woods.</li>
<li>Any off days?</li>
<li>Just to feel women and talent and so on, at my federal age.</li>
