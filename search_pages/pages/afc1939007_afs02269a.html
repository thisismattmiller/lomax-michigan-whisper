<li>2269, A1 and 2.</li>
<li>The Beaver Brigade is neat, live rigged, on the region line. We have set our sails with the pleasant gale on the coast of Spain.</li>
<li>With crew she's been well-mended, her anchors we did weigh. And on Lafayel away she's board bound for America.</li>
<li>The wind did blow from the southwest, the weather had been clear. At night when I'm in slumber, I still think of my dear.</li>
<li>If she's been as liable as I took her far to be, I'd be rolling in her arms in the land of liberty.</li>
<li>At night for a warm exit, how freely I would share it all, well, well, well, you will adore.</li>
<li>Too bad. I learned that my dad, years ago, he learned it in Ireland. And you don't know what it's about, what it tells about.</li>
<li>Well, it's just a ship bound for this country, taking a broken-hearted, non-hearted, non-hearted man away about his lover.</li>
<li>Goes on then telling, you know, about, you know, about, you know, but this is it. This is it now. Oh, yes, absolutely, absolutely.</li>

<li>What's your name? First name. How old are you? Fifty-five.</li>
