<li>2273-B</li>
<li>There was a fine ship in this dark country</li>
<li>And she went by the name of the bold trinity</li>
<li>As she sailed on the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low as she sailed on the lonesome sea</li>
<li>There was another ship in this dark country</li>
<li>And she went by the name of the Turkish Admiral</li>
<li>As she lay on the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low as she lay on the lonesome sea</li>
<li>Some played cards and more played dice</li>
<li>For to see which of them could give the best advice</li>
<li>For to sink her in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low for to sink her in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>Then up stepped our little cabin boy, saying what will you give me</li>
<li>If I do her distry, if I sink her in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low if I sink her in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>I'll give you clothes and I'll give you food</li>
<li>And likewise my only docker to marry unto you</li>
<li>If you sink her in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low if you sink her in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>Then he got on his back and away swam he</li>
<li>Until he came to the Turkish Admiral</li>
<li>As she lay on the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low as she lay on the lonesome sea</li>
<li>He had a little auger that was fitting for the use</li>
<li>And he bore nine holes for to let the water loose</li>
<li>For to sink her in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low for to sink her in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>Then he turned on his back and away swam he</li>
<li>Until he came to the board from the sea as she lay on the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low as she lay on the lonesome sea</li>
<li>Oh captain, dear captain, go take me on board</li>
<li>And give unto me they promise you have me told</li>
<li>For I sank her in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low I sank her in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>Oh no, no I won't take you on board</li>
<li>Or give unto you the promise I have you told</li>
<li>But I'll leave you in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low I'll leave you in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>If it wasn't for the love I have for your crew</li>
<li>I will do unto you as I've done unto thee</li>
<li>I will sink you in the low land</li>
<li>Low land, low I will sink you in the lonesome sea</li>
<li>[silence]</li>
