<li>2271A.</li>
<li>In this gallagher, a man so brave and young, and his parents home, let no less know the tidings of their son.</li>
<li>It is now the pain of sorrow that will pierce a mother's heart, as she learns a dame has come so soon for a boy from her must part.</li>
<li>'Twas but a few short weeks before when Emmett he had said, There's a place out in Lake Ewing that will not give up its dead.</li>
<li>It is called a sailor's graveyard, those words he was known to say. As he stood out on the eclipsed instead, he showed them where it lay.</li>
<li>We have them, three more friends are gone, we're in its company. Brought up on Beaver Island, and that followed up the sea.</li>
<li>'Twas Anthony, McDonough, Joe Scheid and Peter Byrne. We hope to meet them back again, and wish their glad return.</li>
<li>Young Anthony, a mate on board, he has sailed the ocean blue. He had come back to the Great Lakes, and had joined the Clifton's crew.</li>
<li>To be among companions of his early boyhood dame, he was doomed like many more on board to fill a sailor's grave.</li>
<li>Among our four companions on the Clifton that were drowned, Joe Scheid was only one of them was ever found.</li>
<li>Their lifeless forms in silence now are drifting far and wide, 'til they waste away from day to day and wear with time and tide.</li>
<li>Their fathers they will not forget, that day so sad and long, when their thoughts were all the Clifton and their dear boys that are gone.</li>
<li>Also their sisters they will weep and mourn their brothers dear, whose smiles they'll never more behold, their saddened hearts to cheer.</li>
<li>Our homes have not been held alike in many years before, not since the steamer burning sank out off Wisconsin shore.</li>
<li>As some they hold in memory still, and some were then not born, who perished on the Clifton through the darkness and the storm.</li>
<li>They are three of them, 'tis sad to say, no mother home have they. They are gone before their children and are long since slayed away.</li>
<li>They say there is a mother who has seen through many storms and has prayed for those who come to her in danger and in harm.</li>
<li>She is our blessed mother, as the holy people say, is called the queen of heaven and then sorrows in her day.</li>
<li>She has left to many a midnight prayer from many a sailor boy, and with God has blessed those hidden graves, they now in peace may lay.</li>
