<li>Lord Thomas loved the bowl for a star, And chaser of the king's deer;</li>
<li>There Ellen was a young lady, And Lord Thomas loved her dear, Her dear and Lord Thomas loved her dear.</li>
<li>Come, riddle, my riddle, dear mother, she said, Come, riddle it all in one.</li>
<li>Will I go to Lord Thomas' wedding, Or will I stay at home, Home, or will I stay at home?</li>
<li>Oh, hundreds are our friends, dear daughter, And thousands are our foes,</li>
<li>And I would betide you on my blest, O Lord, Thomas' wedding don't go.</li>
<li>Go to Lord Thomas' wedding don't go.</li>
<li>She dressed herself, Hundreds are our friends, dear mother, And thousands are our foes,</li>
<li>As dear as life and sweet as death, To Lord Thomas' wedding don't go.</li>
<li>Go out to Lord Thomas' wedding don't go.</li>
<li>She dressed herself in a gallant attire, As she walked o'er the plains,</li>
<li>And every one that seen her said, She looked just like a queen, Queen, she looked just like a queen.</li>
<li>She rode up to Lord Thomas' gate, And she trinkled at the ring,</li>
<li>And no one was readier than Lord Thomas, To let fair Ellen in, into that fair Ellen.</li>
<li>Is that your bride, fair Ellen, did she say, I think she looks mighty brown,</li>
<li>You might have had the fairest maid, That ever the sun shone on,</li>
<li>On that ever the sun shone on.</li>
<li>Despise her not, Lord Thomas did say, Despise her not unto me,</li>
<li>For better I love your little finger Than all her whole body, than all her whole body.</li>
<li>And the brown girl had a little pinknife, That was both keen and sharp,</li>
<li>And between the long rib and the short, She pierced fair Ellen's heart, heart she pierced fair Ellen's heart.</li>
<li>Oh, Lord, forgive me, fair Ellen, it cried, May Lord forgive at me,</li>
<li>Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood, Run-trinkling down my knee, run-trinkling down my knee.</li>
<li>Lord Thomas had a sword by his side, As he walked through the hall,</li>
<li>He cut off the brown girl's head, And he threw it against the wall, wall,</li>
<li>And he threw it against the wall.</li>
