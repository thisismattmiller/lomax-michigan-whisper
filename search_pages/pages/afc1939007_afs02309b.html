<li>Oh, I'm a roving, that's my name</li>
<li>I'm going to leave my native land</li>
<li>For to leave my dear old girl behind</li>
<li>Who oft times told me her heart was mine</li>
<li>As she lie folded in my arms</li>
<li>I thought she was ten thousand charms</li>
<li>With pompom eyes and a kiss so sweet</li>
<li>Saying we'll get married next time we meet</li>
<li>With a pompom eyes and a kiss so sweet</li>
<li>Saying we'll get married next time we meet</li>
<li>As he went sailing o'er the sea</li>
<li>He took his comfort and his ease</li>
<li>Writing letters to his dear</li>
<li>But not one word from her could hear</li>
<li>Writing letters to his dear</li>
<li>But not one word from her could hear</li>
<li>As he rode up to her father's hall</li>
<li>And loud like for his loved did call</li>
<li>His father, her father made him this reply</li>
<li>My daughter, she's married to a sacred boy</li>
<li>Her father made him this reply</li>
<li>My daughter, she's married to a sacred boy</li>
<li>I cursed Otero</li>
<li>That's again what this did mean</li>
<li>Oh, he answered me all in her name</li>
<li>My daughter, she's married to a richer class</li>
<li>So you can seek for another lass</li>
<li>My daughter, she's married to a richer class</li>
<li>So you can seek for another lass</li>
<li>Oh, it's cursed to the gold and the silver too</li>
<li>It's cursed to the girl that won't prove true</li>
<li>That will her own true promise break</li>
<li>And marry another for a richer sake</li>
<li>That will her own true promise break</li>
<li>And marry another for a richer sake</li>
<li>Since I have lost my golden crown</li>
<li>I'll sail the ocean round and round</li>
<li>I'll sail the sea till the day I die</li>
<li>I'll split the waves where the bullets fly</li>
<li>I'll sail the sea till the day I die</li>
<li>I'll split the waves where the bullets fly</li>
<li>The other day as I was going by</li>
<li>I thought I heard the angels cry</li>
<li>But instead of them, oh it's there sat she</li>
<li>She was a-weeping then for me</li>
<li>Will they, will they stay at home</li>
<li>Oh, it's love don't go where the raging foam</li>
<li>Oh, it's love don't go where the bullets fly</li>
<li>'Cause many a-prick your lass and I</li>
<li>(clears throat)</li>
<li>- Why did you learn that?</li>
<li>- I learned that in the Longwoods too.</li>
<li>- Really? - Yeah.</li>
<li>- Work? - Huh?</li>
<li>- Work? - In the Longwoods.</li>
<li>- What does this mean, power?</li>
