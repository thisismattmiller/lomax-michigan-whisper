<li>A.F.S. recording number two, three, four, two, side A, strips one, two, and three.</li>
<li>A Hebrew and two Irishmen in search of recreation went out into the woods one day to spend a</li>
<li>vacation.</li>
<li>Now they got lost way out in the woods and it was dark and lonely and all the food they</li>
<li>had gave out but one piece of bologna.</li>
<li>Now I suggest we all go to bed, shouted Mike Mahoney.</li>
<li>Whoever has the nicest dream, he gets the bologna.</li>
<li>Now they got up the following morn, a quarter after seven.</li>
<li>The first friend said, I had a dream and I went to heaven.</li>
<li>Now I went through the pearly gates riding on a pony.</li>
<li>Now you can't beat a dream like that, so I get the bologna.</li>
<li>The second friend said, I had a dream, I died from overeating.</li>
<li>I went through the pearly gates, oh, what a greeting.</li>
<li>Now old St. Peter smilingly said, How are you, Mahoney?</li>
<li>Now you can't beat a dream like that, so I get the bologna.</li>
<li>Now Levi says, You're telling the truth, I know you are not lying.</li>
<li>I had a dream that both of you died, oh, I was crying and you went up to heaven and then</li>
<li>then I felt so lonely, I dreamed you wasn't coming back, so I ate the bologna.</li>
<li>[Pause]</li>
<li>My wild Irish nose has spoiled my sweet repose.</li>
<li>Cognacious and grim, it always butts in my wild Irish nose.</li>
<li>My wild Irish nose, you can hear it when it blows.</li>
<li>And someday for my sake, a prohibition will take that bloom from my wild Irish nose.</li>
<li>Give me the chalk with which you marked the baseball scorer, I'll paint that lovely medal</li>
<li>upon this byroom floor.</li>
<li>And another drink, and with the chalk in hand, this vagabond began, to sketch a face that</li>
<li>well might buy the soul of any man.</li>
<li>And as he placed another look across that shapely head with a fearful streak, he leaped</li>
<li>and fell, huck-huck, picture dead.</li>
<li>[Applause]</li>
<li>[End of recording]</li>
<li>[Applause]</li>
