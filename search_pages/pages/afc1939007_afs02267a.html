<li>2267, A1 and 2.</li>
<li>Don't judge a man by the cost of his clothing</li>
<li>or heeding a life path that he may pursue.</li>
<li>For you'll often admire all the hearts that meet clothing</li>
<li>and fail to give honor where honor is due.</li>
<li>Then give me a man as a friend or a neighbor</li>
<li>that toils with the lumo, the state or the plow,</li>
<li>and earns his diploma by manual labor</li>
<li>and purchased his wealth by the sweat of his brow.</li>
<li>Oh, the palms may be hard and the fingers stiff-jointed</li>
<li>and the coat may be tattered, cheeks worn with care.</li>
<li>For there's many the true hearts beneath rags lies beating.</li>
<li>So you can't judge a man by the coat that he wears.</li>
<li>Then why should the broad cloth alone be respected?</li>
<li>And a man be despised, oh, because he is poor.</li>
<li>For the angels in heaven have their limbs unprotected.</li>
<li>So you can't judge a man by the coat that he wears.</li>
<li>If you can do a good turn, don't do a bad one.</li>
<li>Only then let live maybe your motto through life.</li>
<li>For a kind word or action is as cheap as a bad one.</li>
<li>So rent from your bosom, oh, feeling all strife.</li>
<li>Let them that has wealth help the starving and needy.</li>
<li>For remember that this world is only a spell.</li>
<li>For wealth it can purchase your life for a moment</li>
<li>when before he who judged not the coat but the man.</li>
<li>That's the halibut.</li>
<li>You talk of excitement so racy and rare</li>
<li>of underground currents that wind up in air.</li>
<li>Of underground currents prospecting the soil</li>
<li>in search of a place to go boring for oil.</li>
<li>It was on one of these rambles that I met a fair dame</li>
<li>so much likely to her I did say.</li>
<li>Here's for a large fortune I'm willing to toil.</li>
<li>Could you show me a place to go boring for oil?</li>
<li>Boring, boring, boring, boring.</li>
<li>You talk of excitement so racy and rare</li>
<li>of underground currents that wind up in air.</li>
<li>It was on one of these rambles that I met a fair dame</li>
<li>so much likely to her I did say.</li>
<li>Could you show me a place to go boring for oil?</li>
<li>Boring, boring, boring, boring.</li>
<li>You talk of excitement so racy and rare</li>
<li>of underground currents that wind up in air.</li>
<li>Of underground currents prospecting the soil</li>
<li>in search of a place to go boring for oil.</li>
<li>On one of these rambles I met a fair dame</li>
<li>so much likely to toil.</li>
<li>Could you show me a place to go boring for oil?</li>
<li>She stuttered and stammered young men I declared.</li>
<li>I know of a place and I've watched it with scare.</li>
<li>And no man has seen it since I've been a child.</li>
<li>And if you boy there you will surely strike oil.</li>
<li>And I bet her sit down on Aaron's green no.</li>
<li>She hoisted her garments for fear they'd get soil.</li>
<li>And I took out my auger and went boring for oil.</li>
<li>I hadn't bored more than six inches or so.</li>
<li>When the oil frothed six inches.</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
