<li>2356A</li>
<li>In the barren lands of Scotland where the bluebell gently tolls,</li>
<li>there lived a mate both fair and bright out in the lowlands low.</li>
<li>And often times it had been said all along the banks of Clyde,</li>
<li>although her cottage was low and neat she was called the village bride.</li>
<li>An officer from Paisley town came calling there one day</li>
<li>a way out in the lowlands blinds where Mary's cottage lay.</li>
<li>Often times a smiling glancy kept all on her farm so fair.</li>
<li>And was little did he think that so fair a flower could bloom and flurry spare.</li>
<li>As Henry turned from chase one day on his face he wore no smile</li>
<li>saying Mary dearest Mary far from you I must go.</li>
<li>My regiment has been called on and I'm to receive command</li>
<li>all far to exchange from the lowland Clyde for India's burning sand.</li>
<li>Oh Mary dearest Mary I'm afraid it will break my heart.</li>
<li>I wish you were my wedded wife and that before we part</li>
<li>to have you go along with me has been my whole desire.</li>
<li>Then I your waiting man will be all dressed in men's attire.</li>
<li>They both set out for Paisley town and leave without delay</li>
<li>to see that gallant wedlock room so gallant and so gay.</li>
<li>The people all admired her as they stood on parade.</li>
<li>Was little did they think that a soldier's coat concealed so fair a mane.</li>
<li>And now as they crossed over into India's burning sand</li>
<li>no tongue could tell what Mary stood out in that backless land.</li>
<li>And when she found her strength was gone a mound she strived to climb.</li>
<li>And turning around with a pleasant smile stood young Henry by her side.</li>
<li>And as the battle was raging high a ball is pierced his sight.</li>
<li>He never raised from her he fell but on the spot he died.</li>
<li>She picked him from his bloody gourd and in part Arnhem's friend.</li>
<li>And as she strived to ease his pain a ball is pierced her breath.</li>
<li>I'm afraid your deep blue-eye deep blue-eye deep blue-eye deep blue-eye</li>
<li>is young Henry he didn't say.</li>
<li>I'm afraid your deep blue-eye wounded love your lips your lips look like the clay.</li>
<li>It's ever since I first saw your face you're the girl I do adore.</li>
<li>And they closed their eyes their eyes their eyes their eyes their eyes their eyes their eyes</li>
<li>no more to ride on India's burning shore.</li>
