<li>Stop a noted highwayman, the truth to you I'll tell His name was Willie Brandon, in</li>
<li>Ireland he did well It was on the Calvert Mountains he started</li>
<li>his divvish career Which made many a wealthy gentleman before</li>
<li>him shake the fear of Brandon on the moor And bold and undaunted still to Brandon on</li>
<li>the moor A case of a brace of loaded pistols he carried</li>
<li>with him each day He never robbed a poor man up on the Queen's</li>
<li>highway But what he had taken from the rich like</li>
<li>carpets and black vests he always did divide it with the widows in distress</li>
<li>Oh, Brandon on the moor A bold and undaunted still to Brandon on</li>
<li>the moor One day he met a pack man by the name of Jorobon</li>
<li>And they traveled along together till the day began to dawn</li>
<li>And Willie found his pack was gone likewise his watch and chain</li>
<li>And he quickly did encounter him and robbed him back again</li>
<li>Oh, Brandon on the moor A bold and undaunted still to Brandon on</li>
<li>the moor As Willie's wife was going to town some provisions</li>
<li>for to buy And when she saw her Willie she began to</li>
<li>sob and cry He lost his form his finger was shot off</li>
<li>by a ball And Brandon and his comrade were taken after all</li>
<li>Oh, Brandon on the moor A bold and undaunted still to Brandon on</li>
<li>the moor Well, that ain't all of it either, but I</li>
<li>can't remember.</li>
<li>Did you ever hear any stories about Brandon on the moor?</li>
<li>Yeah, I read an article about him.</li>
<li>When was he a robber and how long ago was that?</li>
<li>Oh, God, it was a long time ago, but I couldn't remember when, but there was such a guy, all</li>
<li>right.</li>
<li>And then I tell you about Dirkis, our carpenter in Black Death here.</li>
<li>Did you ever learn that song about Dirkis back there?</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Mm-hmm.</li>
<li>Do you remember or have you ever heard any songs about him?</li>
<li>No, when French food proved unfaithful I took to the road</li>
<li>No poor man I plundered or orphaned molest With kindness I shot to my bunny Black Death</li>
<li>Oh, I, it's a long night out there Did you ever learn of the bold?</li>
