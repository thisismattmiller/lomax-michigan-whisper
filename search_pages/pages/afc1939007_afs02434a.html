<li>2434 A1, 2, and 3</li>
<li>This song was composed in Varner, Ontario.</li>
<li>Composed by Fred Carrier.</li>
<li>As I was a-walking down Fair New York Street,</li>
<li>A handsome young sailor I chanced for to me.</li>
<li>What, brother, a sailor would you tell unto me?</li>
<li>I belong to the land seat from England I be.</li>
<li>We're in want of a sailor, do you understand?</li>
<li>For we want a sailor, for we lost a man.</li>
<li>Indeed, I'm no sailor, but if you want a man.</li>
<li>For my passage over, I'll do all I can.</li>
<li>Our ship were got ready for the setting of sail.</li>
<li>The wind did blow peace at any pleasant gale.</li>
<li>As we were off sailing o'er the bright pees.</li>
<li>As I was a-walking down Fair New York Street,</li>
<li>A handsome young sailor I chanced for to me.</li>
<li>What, brother, a sailor would you tell unto me?</li>
<li>I belong to the land seat from England I be.</li>
<li>We're in want of a sailor, do you understand?</li>
<li>For we want a sailor, for we lost a man.</li>
<li>Indeed, I'm no sailor, but if you want a man.</li>
<li>For my passage over, I'll do all I can.</li>
<li>Our ship were got ready for the setting of sail.</li>
<li>The wind did blow peace at any pleasant gale.</li>
<li>As we were off sailing o'er the bright evening tide.</li>
<li>Our ship sprung a-leakin' to the bottom she went.</li>
<li>We were twenty-four of us got into a boat.</li>
<li>And over the ocean, six weeks, we did float.</li>
<li>Provision been scarce, boys, and it's drawing night.</li>
<li>We had to cast lot four to see who would die.</li>
<li>Our blots were got ready in a bag they did shake.</li>
<li>This young man caught lot three with two.</li>
<li>In a bag they did shake, each man held his breath while there is no nothing to take.</li>
<li>But this handsome young sailor, the short lot he threw.</li>
<li>He was to be sprung four to feed our ship's crew.</li>
<li>Oh, hold your hand, butcher, this young man did cry.</li>
<li>I'm not what you thought of me, ship-shatter boy.</li>
<li>I'm a rich merchant's daughter from England, I read.</li>
<li>And see what I've come to by the loving of thee.</li>
<li>Those lots were got ready in a bag they did shake.</li>
<li>To see which of the lots this young fair was okay.</li>
<li>If you'll be the fair one that I do love best.</li>
<li>Have a long, happy life.</li>
<li>Love for you, how to die further.</li>
