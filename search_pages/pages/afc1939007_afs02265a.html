<li>Not a thing on the river, McClusky did fear. As he pulled the stick or the big spotted steers,</li>
<li>they were young, quick and sound, gherting eight feet and three, said McClusky the scotchman,</li>
<li>'There the lad is for me.' Bull Gordon, the Yankee of Skidding, was full. As he said, 'Whoa-ho!'</li>
<li>to his little brown bull, short-legged and soggy, gherting six feet and nine, said McClusky the scotchman,</li>
<li>'Too light for our pine.' 'Twas three to the thousand, our contract did call. The skidding was good for,</li>
<li>the timber was tall. McClusky, for that, he'd make the day full, and he'd skid two to one of the little brown bull.</li>
<li>'Oh no,' said Bull Gordon, 'that you cannot do, although we all know you, the pet of the crew. But mark you, my boy,</li>
<li>you will have your hands full, if you skid one more log than my little brown bull.' The day was appointed,</li>
<li>and soon it's draw night, for twenty-five dollars their fortunes to try. Each eager and anxious that morning were found,</li>
<li>as the scalers and judges appeared on the ground. With a hope and a yell came McClusky to view,</li>
<li>with his big spotted deers, the pets of the crew, both chewing their cuds. 'Oh boys, keep your jaws full,</li>
<li>for you easily can beat them, the little brown bull.' Then out stepped Bull Gordon with pipe in his jaw,</li>
<li>with his little brown bulls with their cuds in their mouths, and little did we think when we see them come down,</li>
<li>that a hundred and forty they could jerk around. Then up spoke McClusky, 'Come, dip to the skin, for I'll dig you a hole,</li>
<li>and I'll tumble you in. I will learn a damn yankee to face a bull scot. I will cook you a dose, and you'll get it red hot.'</li>
<li>Said Gordon to Seven with blood in his eyes, 'Today we must conquer McClusky or die.' Then up spoke old Kennebec,</li>
<li>'Oh boy, never fear, for you never will be beaten by the big spotted deer.' The sun had gone down when the foreman did say,</li>
<li>'Turn out boys, turn out, you've enough for the day.' We have scaled and then counted them, each man to his team,</li>
<li>and it's well do we know now which one kicked the bean. After supper was over, McClusky appeared with a belt ready made for his big spotted deer.</li>
<li>To farm it, he'd torn up his vest and back on off, for he'd, for he'd,</li>
<li>for he'd,</li>
