<li>AFS recording number two three four three, side A.</li>
<li>A bunch of boys were hooding it up in a male mule saloon, and the kid that trickled the music box was playing a ragtime tune.</li>
<li>When back at the bar in his solo game sat dangerous Dan McGrew while watching his luck with the light of his love for the woman that was known as Lou.</li>
<li>When out of the night which was fifty below and into the dim in a glare, there stumbled a miner just fresh from the creek, dog dirty and loaded for bear.</li>
<li>He looked like a man with one foot in a grave and scarciest drinks of a louse, as he tiled a poke of dust on a bar and he calls for the drunk, drinks for the house, for the house, for the house, for the house.</li>
<li>None could place that stranger's face though we searched ourselves for a clue, but we drank to his health and the last to drink was dangerous Dan McGrew.</li>
<li>There are men that just somehow just grip their eyes and hold them fast for a spell, for such was he for he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell.</li>
<li>With a face most hair and a glossy stare, like a dog whose day is done as he watered the green stuff in his glass and the drops fell one by one.</li>
<li>Then I got to figuring who he was and I wondered what he'd do when I turned in there and stood watching him with the lady that was known as Lou.</li>
<li>The stranger's eyes wandered round the room and it seemed in a kind of a dizz, till at last the old piano fell in the way of the wandering gaze.</li>
<li>The ragtime kid was having a drink, there was no one else on the stool and the stranger stumbled across the room and flops down there like a fool in a buckskin shirt with shirt with shirt with shirt with shirt which was glazed with dirt as he watched as he sat icing him sway.</li>
<li>With a talented hand he clutched the keys, God but that man could play.</li>
<li>Were you ever out in the great alone when the night was awfully clear and the icy mountains held you in with the silence that you most could hear?</li>
<li>With the only howl of a timber wolf as you camped out there in the cold in a half dead thing in a stark dead world, clean mad for the muck all gold, and high overhead the green, yellow, and red the northern light's weapon bars, then you have a hunch with the music men, the hunger, night, and the stars.</li>
<li>The music almost died away, so soft as you feel, so soft as you feel, so soft as you feel, and you thought your life had been eluded of all that once held dear, and someone had stolen your darling, and our love was a devil's lie, and your guts were gone and the best for you was to crawl away and die, for the glory, heart of despair.</li>
<li>The music almost died away, then burst up like a plan of blood, and it seemed to say repay, repay, and your eyes went blind with blood, and a thought came back like an ancient wrong, and it stunned like a frozen lie, and the lust awoke to kill to kill, and the music stopped like a flash.</li>
<li>The ragtime kill, the ragtime kill, the ragtime kill, the ragtime kill, the ragtime kill, which was having drinks, in a buckskin shirt which was glazed with dirt as he sat, I seen him sway.</li>
<li>His lips went in in a kind of a grin, a grin, a grin, but the folk in his voice was wrong, and boys, he says, you don't know me and none of you give a damn, but I want to state my words thus rate, and I bet my folk they're true, that one of you is a hound from hell, and that one is Dan McGrew.</li>
<li>I ducked my head and the lights went out, two guns they blazed in, they blazed in, they blazed in, they blazed in the dark, the lights went up and a woman screamed, two men lay stiff and stark, pitched on his, pitched on his, pitched on his head and plunked full of lead, lay dangerous Dan McGrew, while a man from the creek lay crushed on the, lay crushed on the, lay crushed on the breast of the lady that was known as Lou.</li>
<li>Now these are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know, they, they, they say the stranger was crazed with hooch, but I'm not denying it so, but I'm not so wise as a lawyer guides us strictly between us two, the woman that kissed and pinched his poke was the woman that was known as Lou.</li>
<li>known as low.</li>
<li>(fire crackling)</li>
