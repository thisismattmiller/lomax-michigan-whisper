<li>- 2274B.</li>
<li>On the 14th of July we sailed from the land</li>
<li>On the Bull Prince's rile bound for Newfoundland</li>
<li>We had not been sailing past two weeks or three</li>
<li>When the man from the lookout assailed he deceived</li>
<li>Lord God fed our captain at this</li>
<li>On the 14th of July we sailed from the land</li>
<li>On the Bull Prince's rile bound for Newfoundland</li>
<li>We had not been sailing past two weeks or three</li>
<li>When the man from the lookout assailed he deceived</li>
<li>Lord God fed our captain at this, it is true</li>
<li>At this day a pirate he'll soon fetch us too</li>
<li>And out spoke our chief page and answered him so</li>
<li>We'll shake out our refines and from him we'll go</li>
<li>He came bearing down on us as sails spread so high</li>
<li>And under his mizzen by colors it flies</li>
<li>He bent on more canvas and from his bow he did so</li>
<li>The white foaming bellows like mountains of snow</li>
<li>A few hours after he rang the long side</li>
<li>Through a loud speaking compact when came you he cried</li>
<li>Back up your main capsule and heave your ship too</li>
<li>For I have the message to send along with you</li>
<li>He shook out our refines our colors that fly</li>
<li>And our captain to answer he made his surprise</li>
<li>If I back up my main capsule and heave my ship too</li>
<li>It'll be in some harbor not alongside of you</li>
<li>And the case goes to inwards for an hour or two</li>
<li>And the case goes to inwards for all they could do</li>
<li>They fired shots after but could not prevail</li>
<li>For the bold prince is royal yet show them her tail</li>
<li>Thank God that our captain the pirate is gone</li>
<li>Here's a bumper of brandy for all hands around</li>
<li>Go down to your broadbite and be of good cheer</li>
<li>For while we've got serum we've got nothing to fear</li>
<li>(indistinct)</li>
<li>- First, where'd you learn this from?</li>
<li>(indistinct)</li>
<li>- I've not known very well around here.</li>
<li>- Who else knows better around here?</li>
<li>- I don't know.</li>
<li>- Very well known.</li>
<li>- The lady over there gave you a little more...</li>
<li>- Did she bring it here?</li>
<li>- Oh, I don't think so.</li>
<li>Now, I don't know that, I couldn't think of it.</li>
<li>- Is it a two-tone?</li>
<li>- We'll say it is.</li>
<li>- Where was the...</li>
<li>Where was this ship from, American ship?</li>
<li>- No, I think she was a British ship.</li>
