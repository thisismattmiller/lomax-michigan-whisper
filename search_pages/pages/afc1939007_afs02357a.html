<li>When I just left off, here...</li>
<li>[Pause]</li>
<li>Boys, it is here, and McCluskey did swear.</li>
<li>As he tore out in hands full, his long yellow hair.</li>
<li>Says McCluskey to garden, my money I'll pull.</li>
<li>And the belt you may keep for those little brown bulls.</li>
<li>Here's a health to Bull Garden and Sunsbury John.</li>
<li>The biggest day's work on the river had done.</li>
<li>So it's fill up your glasses and fill them up full.</li>
<li>And we'll all take a drink on those little brown bulls.</li>
<li>[Pause]</li>
<li>In a quiet little village not so very far away.</li>
<li>There lived a rich and aged man whose locks were few and gray.</li>
<li>He had three sons, three only ones, while Jack and Tom were sly.</li>
<li>But Ted was honest as could be and wouldn't tell a lie.</li>
<li>They tried their best to ruin Ted that's in the old man's eyes.</li>
<li>Their poison soon began its work and Ted was much despised.</li>

<li>One night the old man says, Begone, you're heartless to the core.</li>
<li>These was the words, the laugh, the laugh, the laugh, the laugh beside the door.</li>
<li>Don't be angry with me, Dad, don't turn me from your door.</li>
<li>I know I've been wayward, but I won't be anymore.</li>
<li>Guilt to me another chance, just put me to the test.</li>
<li>And you'll find the black sheep loves his dad far better than the rest.</li>
<li>The years passed quickly on, the old man was growing old.</li>
<li>He called both Jack and Tom to him, gave to them all his gold.</li>
<li>Says, I only need this little card to play and your far side.</li>
<li>One night while Jack was returning home, he brought him a bride.</li>
