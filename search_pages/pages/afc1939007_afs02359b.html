<li>2359B</li>
<li>[Footsteps]</li>
<li>From Liverpool across the Atlantic</li>
<li>Our good ship was soaring the deep</li>
<li>The weather, the skies above us, the sunshine</li>
<li>And the waters beneath us asleep</li>
<li>Not a bad tempered man was among us</li>
<li>A jollier crew never sailed</li>
<li>Except the first mate, a bit of a savage</li>
<li>But good seaman as ever was hailed</li>
<li>Regulations and ardor his motto</li>
<li>Strong as iron and steady and quick</li>
<li>With a pair of bushy black eyebrows</li>
<li>And eyes fierce as those of old Nick</li>
<li>He came up from below one bright morning</li>
<li>Seizing a lad by the arm</li>
<li>A poor little golden haired orphan</li>
<li>Wed off to been home with his ma</li>
<li>He then asked the lad rather roughly</li>
<li>How he dared to be stowing away</li>
<li>Cheating the owners and captains</li>
<li>Eating, sailing and all without say</li>
<li>Then the lad with the sob voice, soft and flatting</li>
<li>Says my stepmother brought me aboard</li>
<li>And hid me a way down the stairs there</li>
<li>To keep me she couldn't afford</li>
<li>'Tis a lie says the mate, not your mother</li>
<li>But some of these big skulkers near</li>
<li>Some soft headed milk hearted sailor</li>
<li>Speak up, tell the truth, don't you hear</li>
<li>Then</li>
<li>Then the mate</li>
<li>Boy with the voice, soft and flatting</li>
<li>Says sir, I have told you the truth</li>
<li>Then he</li>
<li>The mate went</li>
<li>Face fluttered with anger</li>
<li>And he tumbled the poor lad below</li>
<li>Saying perhaps by tomorrow we'll change you</li>
<li>If not back to old England you go</li>
<li>It was not your mother that brought you</li>
<li>But some of these big skulkers near</li>
<li>And to the lad rather roughly</li>
<li>Speak up, tell the truth, don't you hear</li>
<li>Then the boy kind of shut</li>
<li>Faltingly asked, may I pray</li>
<li>Then the mate kind of shuddered and trembled</li>
<li>And nodded his head in reply</li>
<li>Though his face it was white all of a sudden</li>
<li>And the bright lights were quenched in his eyes</li>
<li>And while the lad on the deck knelt before us</li>
<li>His hands he clasped over his friend</li>
<li>As he must have done all time at home</li>
<li>That night time when going to rest</li>
<li>The mate kind of shut</li>
<li>Gosh I can't, gosh I can't</li>
<li>[ Silence ]</li>
