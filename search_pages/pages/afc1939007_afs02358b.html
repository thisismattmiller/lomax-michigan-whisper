<li>The Man in Darby Town</li>
<li>There lived a man in Darby Town who owned a mighty ram</li>
<li>And he rambled, he did ramble, he did ramble till the butchers cut him down</li>
<li>Oh, the wool was on this ram's belly, it grew into the ground</li>
<li>The devil stole three strands and he wove himself a gown and didn't he ramble</li>
<li>He did ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>The wool was on this ram's back, it grew up to the moon</li>
<li>The eagles built a nest in it for a year the young one squalled and didn't he ramble</li>
<li>He did ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>Oh, this ram he jumped so high, his tail it touched the sky</li>
<li>He went up in February, he didn't come down till June and didn't he ramble</li>
<li>He did ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>He had a pair of horns, they reached up to the moon</li>
<li>One came out of his forehead, the other came out as a ruptured loader</li>
<li>Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>The man that butchered this ram was scared of his life</li>
<li>He sent to Philadelphia and he got him a four foot knife and didn't he ramble</li>
<li>He did ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>It took four big yokes of oxen to roll away his stones</li>
<li>It took all the girls who garbied town to suck the head of his yupps to do the lolly</li>
<li>Didn't he ramble, he did ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>His head was in the meat market, his ass was on the street</li>
<li>All the ladies come along and said here's your market's meat</li>
<li>Didn't he ramble, he had ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>The man that owned this ram was considered very rich</li>
<li>Or the man who told the story was a lion son of a yupps to do the lolly</li>
<li>Didn't he ramble, he did ramble, he did ramble till those butchers cut him down</li>
<li>I never thought of it till now</li>
<li>[The End]</li>
