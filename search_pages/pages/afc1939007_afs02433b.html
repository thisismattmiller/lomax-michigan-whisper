<li>(footsteps)</li>
<li>I'll tell you, Johnny, it was 1900 when I was down there.</li>
<li>I could tell them the year and everything, so I have.</li>
<li>Johnny, you remember when you come down, it was 1900 when I was in Kennedy.</li>
<li>And 1900 exactly, the time of Old Miller Roy, you know, when you come down there.</li>
<li>I got married in 1900, and he was in Kennedy then.</li>
<li>That was before 1900.</li>
<li>No, Johnny, when you got married, you know...</li>
<li>(speaking in French)</li>
<li>Where were we?</li>
<li>(speaking in French)</li>
<li>Sure.</li>
<li>(speaking in French)</li>
<li>Well, it must be 1898 or '99.</li>
<li>'98 or '99.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>I know it was back from Kennedy then.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Where were you living in Kennedy?</li>
<li>I was in Ontario, Kennedy.</li>
<li>Varner, Ontario.</li>
<li>Varner, Ontario, six miles away from town.</li>
<li>In a shack?</li>
<li>Yeah, in a shack, in an old, loud cabin.</li>
<li>Why were you out there?</li>
<li>Well, I was out there because my father had bought a piece of land from the government.</li>
<li>And you had to keep a man, stop him from burning.</li>
<li>And if a man wasn't there, he'd lose his rights.</li>
<li>He had paid $400 for a farm.</li>
<li>So the first year, it wasn't so dangerous, but watch out the second year.</li>
<li>So the first year, I couldn't agree with my stepmother.</li>
<li>So I went away, and I went for Mr. Pino, my brother-in-law,</li>
<li>who had bought a farm right next door neighbor.</li>
<li>To my father, about the same 40 was divided into 40, you know, in two different farms.</li>
<li>So first year, I cleaned for John Pino, my brother-in-law.</li>
<li>I cleaned nine acres clear to the plow.</li>
<li>And the second year, if I didn't work for my father, he'd have lost his rights.</li>
<li>So I went to work, and I worked there, and I cleared another nine acres for him.</li>
<li>I never got a cent for it.</li>
<li>And I went into a camp called Cahill and Conley from Bonfield.</li>
<li>I remember the names of anybody yet that I worked for.</li>
<li>I'm sorry that I didn't get a reputation card.</li>
<li>I've got a paper of what I've done for all those people.</li>
<li>And then I went for Charlie Moore and Glover from Bay City as another one.</li>
<li>See, I remember the names, and that's 50 years ago.</li>
<li>While you were out in the South, you were...</li>
<li>I composed this song of the 24 Serves.</li>
<li>I was all alone.</li>
<li>He'd come for a while, and then he came back to Champaign for any time.</li>
<li>And I stayed perfectly alone all this time.</li>
<li>That came up till fall.</li>
<li>And I was all alone, and I didn't go nowhere.</li>
<li>It was six miles from town.</li>
<li>I thought I'd composed this song.</li>
<li>First, I commenced to think about the life of this and that.</li>
<li>Finally, I got onto the words of the 24 Serves.</li>
<li>A little of one song, a little of another.</li>
<li>I composed it, and it's a nice song.</li>
<li>I don't know.</li>
<li>Let me think it over a little bit.</li>
<li>Yes, yes, yes.</li>
