<li>2268 B1, 2, and 3.</li>
<li>It was in October of '73, we left Beaver Harbor and Paddycombe Sea. Bound away to Traverse City, was our destination to go. We were crossing Lake Michigan for the stormy wind blow.</li>
<li>We left Traverse City at nine the next day, and down to Elk Rapids we then bore our way. We took in our store and to see we did go.</li>
<li>We were crossing Lake Michigan for the stormy wind blow. They look out, she's running before a hard gale. Upset went her rudder and overboard went her sail.</li>
<li>The billows were foaming like mountains of snow. We shall now cross Lake Michigan for the stormy wind blow.</li>
<li>His own brother John Mayett brings my heart sore to think we will never return to the shore. God help our poor parents, their tears down will flow. We'll now cross Lake Michigan for the stormy wind blow.</li>
<li>Yeah, that's all I know. When was this song composed? In '73. Oh, this song was composed about a year after '74, October, about '74.</li>
<li>It was in '74. It was composed by a man by the name of Daniel Malai. He was an old whale fisher. He spent two years among the Eskimos up in the North Pole when he was whale fishing.</li>
<li>Did this wreck happen on Lake Michigan? Yeah, a small boat. Three men went out of this harbor to go to travel the city for supplies and they got there all right and they left in a gale of wind.</li>
<li>They only had a 24 foot boat and she found her and they were all lost.</li>
<li>Well, with those Gallagher boys there was a man by the name of Domri Gallagher and Dan Green who went to Traverse City with those Gallagher boys.</li>
<li>And my uncle, Roddy, stopped them from going back with them and they came with him and his vessel. I know, but just how did he stop them?</li>
<li>Well, he wouldn't let them go because he knew it wasn't fit for them to go out in that open boat, that small boat, you understand?</li>
<li>Yeah, it was bad weather. They'd come across to Traverse City, was it? They were coming to Beaver Island, you understand?</li>
<li>And how was the weather then? Oh, it was bad weather, a gale of wind. And how was the sea rind?</li>
<li>Oh, it was from high. A small boat would blow the top right off the seas and that's why her father was going down into the boat and he said,</li>
<li>You ain't crazy are you to go in that boat today? Well, he said, My wife is sick and I want to get home.</li>
<li>Well, he said, It's better for your wife to be without you for two or three days and to be out with you forever or be without you forever.</li>
<li>That's just the words that Roddy said. And Roddy had took them by the shoulder like that. He was going down the dock.</li>
<li>Now he told me this himself and he said, He pulled me back. He wouldn't let me get into that boat.</li>
<li>That's a fact. And how were both crews lost after that? Yes, they were all lost.</li>
