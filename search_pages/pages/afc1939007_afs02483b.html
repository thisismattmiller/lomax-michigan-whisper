<li>Concerned in this Southern meeting in the Southern state, in the church, they had a party for them.</li>
<li>First on program was Wap Mama. Second was Heavy Hips as Mama. Third was Papa Do Dirty.</li>
<li>Fourth was Mr. Lowdown. Now the reason I call him Brother Lowdown because I know he was a better tree.</li>
<li>And Sister Do Dirty because that was her last name. And Heavy Hips as Mama because she was a large woman.</li>
<li>And Wap Mama because she was still larger all ahead of me.</li>
<li>The first on program is a hymn, I Love the Lord He Heard My Cry and Pityed Every Girl.</li>
