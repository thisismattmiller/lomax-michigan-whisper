<li>Oh, there's nothing on the river of Miklosky to steer, As he cracks his long whip for his big spotted steer.</li>
<li>Goes round plump and handsome, girding nine foot and three, Says Miklosky to the Scotsman, There's the laddies for me.</li>
<li>When along come Bill Gordon, when the skidding is good, Our ring will holler to his little brown bone.</li>
<li>Short-legged and shaggy and six foot and nine, Two lights as Miklosky to handle our pine.</li>
<li>It's five to a thousand, our contract is called, Our skidding is good and our timber is tall.</li>
<li>Remember, my laddy, you have your hands full, When you skid one of those large skidding little brown bones.</li>
<li>All the day was appointed, the time it drew nigh, For twenty-five dollars, their fortunes to try.</li>
<li>Both eager and anxious, next morning they found, The judges, the scaler, appear on the ground.</li>
<li>With a hop and a yell and Miklosky in view, His big spotted steers are the pets of the crew.</li>
<li>And it's true, you're cuddly laddies and fill your jaws full, Knit these little brown bones.</li>
<li>And next come Bill Gordon with a pipe in his paw, With those little brown bones with a cut in the jaw.</li>
<li>Says Gordon to John, there's blood in his eye, This day we will conquer Miklosky or die.</li>
<li>Oh, the sun it went down and the foreman did say, Turn out boys, turn out, you've done enough for today.</li>
<li>You skidded and counted each man to the team, How well we do know who has skidded the beam.</li>
<li>When supper was over, Miklosky appeared with his belt ready, Made for his big spotted steers.</li>
<li>To make it he tore up his best mackinac, He vowed to maintain it according to law.</li>
<li>Oh, it's weight, says the judges, and will hold you awhile, Your big spotted steers are behind just a mile.</li>
<li>You have skidded a hundred and ten and no more, While Gordon has the cube of ten and the score.</li>
<li>Oh, the boys ate the glass and Miklosky did swear, As he pulled out great locks of his long yellow hair.</li>
<li>And says he to Gordon, my dollars, I'll pull this belt you may have, For your little brown bones.</li>
<li>Oh, it's luck to Bill Gordon and Big Barry John, It's the biggest day's work I've ever been done.</li>
<li>So it's fill up your glasses and fill them up full, And drink to the drinks of those little brown,</li>
<li>Little brown, little brown, little brown, little brown.</li>
<li>[Applause]</li>
<li>What's your name?</li>
<li>I'm Cubish.</li>
<li>How do you spell Cubish? How long did you work in the lumber wood?</li>
<li>Oh, I put in about six, seven winters.</li>
<li>Where did you learn the song?</li>
<li>When?</li>
<li>When? Where?</li>
<li>Oh, in camp, some place, I don't know, just where it was.</li>
<li>Well, I'm guessing the time.</li>
<li>I think Buckley and Douglas's camp.</li>
<li>This record was made in Traverse City, September the 3rd, 1938.</li>
<li>[Silence]</li>
