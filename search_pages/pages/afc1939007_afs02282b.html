<li>2282B</li>
<li>I walked out one evening down by a riverside</li>
<li>And I heard a fair maid singing and she filled my heart with pride</li>
<li>Oh heaven bless you savior would you sing me another song</li>
<li>I wish you were my darling kind sir I am too young</li>
<li>Oh the younger that you are my love they better fit for me</li>
<li>I never intended to marry but come along with me</li>
<li>And the night was past a day came on by morning bright and clear</li>
<li>And this young man erode but on his clothes sing fair you well my dear</li>
<li>Oh that was not the promise you made to me down by the riverside</li>
<li>You promised you would marry me and that I would be your bride</li>
<li>Well if I promised I would marry you that's more than I will do</li>
<li>For I never intended to marry anyone as easy one as you</li>
<li>If I had promised for two and two that is more than I can do</li>
<li>For I never intended to marry anyone as easy one as you</li>
<li>Oh there's other rich merchants daughters to the market they can go</li>
<li>And I poor girl must stay at home and rock the cradle</li>
<li>And rock the cradle stem the wheel sing age oh baby oh</li>
<li>Was where I remained all in this place as cruelly wrung as I</li>
<li>There's a nerve in my father's garden and some does call it rue</li>
<li>Until fishes fly and swallows die young men will never prove true</li>
<li>There's a nerve in your father's garden sit down and cry your fill</li>
<li>For when you think of what you've done you may thank your own free will</li>
<li>Do you remember anything about that song?</li>
<li>That is my father's favorite</li>
<li>You remember it from him?</li>
<li>Yeah</li>
<li>Will he bring it tomorrow?</li>
<li>Yeah he brought it tomorrow</li>
<li>Would he tease your mother with it?</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Mother would have had everything</li>
