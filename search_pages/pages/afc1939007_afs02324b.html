<li>[VIDEO PLAYBACK]</li>
<li>- AFS recording number two, three, two, four, side B.</li>
<li>Strips one and two.</li>
<li>[WATER RUNNING]</li>
<li>- Come, all you young fellows, that follow the lake.</li>
<li>Go forth, use iron o'er packets, pure living to make.</li>
<li>As we ship from Chicago, we bid farewell to the shores.</li>
<li>We're bound to Etcina Beach for red iron oars.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their whiskey, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their grub, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>Oh, as the wind in the west and our tops will set high,</li>
<li>we skim the west shore.</li>
<li>My god, she did fly.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their whiskey, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their grub, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>As we sail through the mouth of Green Bay,</li>
<li>before her cut waters she dashed the white fray.</li>
<li>We rounded sand point, her anchor let go.</li>
<li>We furled up her canvas, and all went below.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their whiskey, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their grub, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>Early next morning, we was towed long exile,</li>
<li>and we were made fast to a iron ore pile.</li>
<li>They let down their chute like thunder did roar,</li>
<li>and they emptied their pockets of red iron ores.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their whiskey, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their grub, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>Oh, some use shovels, while others use spades.</li>
<li>Some use wheelbars, each man to his trade.</li>
<li>But we looked like red devils, our fingers all sore.</li>
<li>We kissed, we cursed Eskenabe and their damned iron ores.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their whiskey, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>High dairy, oh, dairy, dairy is down.</li>
<li>Give the sailors their grub, and nothing goes wrong.</li>
<li>At our gate, Williams, she towed out the maids.</li>
<li>The robs, they thought, they were left in the pinch.</li>
<li>But as we passed by them, we bid them goodbye.</li>
<li>Oh, we'll meet you in Cleveland on the 4th of July.</li>
<li>That's all.</li>
<li>The name of that boat is what counts to get a record of.</li>
<li>Name of the maids.</li>
<li>How did they used to sing this song?</li>
<li>Would the one man sing and the boys come in on the chorus?</li>
<li>No, just one man to sing, and nobody came in on it.</li>
<li>No, just one.</li>
<li>Oh, I don't want them, we were all there.</li>
<li>Oh, no, nobody came in on it.</li>
<li>No, no, not them sailors.</li>
<li>They didn't know the song, they wouldn't come in at all.</li>
<li>No, they didn't, but they played it.</li>
<li>Oh, they knew it, but they'd all sing it together, yeah.</li>
<li>Yeah, the rule tried to be funny.</li>
<li>No, if they'd meet in a place like Buffalo or Chicago</li>
<li>or Cleveland or in them places, and get into a slum,</li>
<li>they'd all sing, and they'd sing together, and like that.</li>
<li>(faintly speaking)</li>
