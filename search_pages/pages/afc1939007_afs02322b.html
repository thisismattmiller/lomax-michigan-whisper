<li>This is AFS recording number 2322, side B strips 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>I met Miss Monroe in the morning, her petticoat drippin' with blood.</li>
<li>I asked her what was the matter, 'cause she had been fucked by a stud.</li>
<li>Oh, it's bunched my naked belly, and ticker my old fusee,</li>
<li>and all the hair around your ass were off on the hell of a spree.</li>
<li>There was a young man according me, the off time come to see me,</li>
<li>but when I come to find him out, he only come to see me, plonk, plink, plidy.</li>
<li>Now, wait a minute, have you got that? Have you got her going?</li>
<li>My God, I got that pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty.</li>
<li>There was a young man according me, the off time come to see me, but when I come to find him out, he only come to deceive me, plonk, plink, plidy.</li>
<li>Oh, big white house in Largetown.</li>
<li>See, he placed his arm, is that it? He placed his arm around my waist, and on the floor he throwed me,</li>
<li>and the damnedest thing you ever saw he pulled right out and showed me, plonk, plink, plidy.</li>
<li>Oh, big white house in Largetown.</li>
<li>'Cause I, young man, what do you mean, why do you go a-gunning?</li>
<li>If you cannot hit a standing mark, what the hell would you do with a running, plonk, plink, plidy?</li>
<li>Oh, big white house in Largetown.</li>
<li>I'm just like old Columbus, no regions to explore, I took a snug position through the keyhole in the door.</li>
<li>In the keyhole in the door, the keyhole in the door, I took a snug position through the keyhole in the door.</li>
<li>And up before the mirror this grateful creature stood, viewing her each feature as decent people should.</li>
<li>A dandy sky blue garter on either leg she wore, she was a charming picture through the keyhole in the door.</li>
<li>In the keyhole in the door, the keyhole in the door, she was a charming picture through the keyhole in the door.</li>
<li>Think I take off that shimmy and I could wish for nothing more, and then I saw her do it through the keyhole in the door.</li>
<li>In the keyhole in the door, the keyhole in the door, she was a charming picture through the keyhole in the door.</li>
<li>That's all I ever got.</li>
<li>These songs were sung by Ed Thrasher in Round Lake, Michigan, at the time of the age of 1938.</li>
<li>These two notes are now to be blown on the violin tuner, or D and G.</li>
