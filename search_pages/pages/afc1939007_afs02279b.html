<li>2279B</li>
<li>Oh sad and dismal is the fate that I relate to you.</li>
<li>For the loss of the schooner Persia, our officers and crew.</li>
<li>They sank beneath the water, deep in life to rise no more.</li>
<li>The remembering of the Persia's crew, lost on Lake Yern Shore.</li>
<li>We left Chicago on our lead, our joyful notes resound.</li>
<li>With hearts so full of joy and glee as we were homeward bound.</li>
<li>But little did we think that the Sword of Death would meet us on our way.</li>
<li>With hearts so full of joy and glee within Lake Yern Way.</li>
<li>Around Priskey Isle the seabirds scream, there's a loud and timorous sound.</li>
<li>In mystery their doom is sealed, they did collide some way.</li>
<li>But that is all that will be revealed until the Judgment Day.</li>
<li>When angels take their stand and await the water's blue.</li>
<li>Then they await the water of old faith before the Persia's crew.</li>
<li>There were a crew of us we go as sailors born and bred.</li>
<li>This is a request that they should rest in such a stormy bed.</li>
<li>There were a crew of gals, glad they're lost we do the floor.</li>
<li>While on their beaks their bones will bleak up your stormy shore.</li>
<li>Around Priskey Isle the seabirds scream, there's a loud and timorous sound.</li>
<li>And not until the Judgment Day those bodies won't be found.</li>
<li>They sank beneath the water's deep to rise in life no more.</li>
<li>Remembering all the Persia's crew lost on Lake Yern shore.</li>
<li>And Daniel Sullivan was our mate, his heart was astounded brave.</li>
<li>As ever was compelled by faith to fill a sailor's grave.</li>
<li>Oh Daniel many a friend will weep and on your faithful frown.</li>
<li>They will miss the love dance of your eye back to a seagull town.</li>
<li>Yes Daniel many friends will sigh that faith has on you frown.</li>
<li>We look in vain for your return back in the seagull town.</li>
<li>We'll miss the sigh dance of your eye, your hand will shake no more.</li>
<li>For cold and death you now do lie lost on Lake Yern shore.</li>
<li>Do you want the rest of it?</li>
<li>No gentle mother was there to press their brows at aches and pains.</li>
<li>No loving wife was there to kiss their cold lips over again.</li>
<li>No lovers there no sister and I they met their fate alone.</li>
<li>Down in their deep they'll all be asleep far from their friends and home.</li>
<li>They'll all be asleep far from their friends and home.</li>
