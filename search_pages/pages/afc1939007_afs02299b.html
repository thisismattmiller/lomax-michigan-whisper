<li>When they arrived in Cape Town</li>
<li>They rumored it arised</li>
<li>That Terry the informer</li>
<li>Was with them in disguise</li>
<li>The pop had struck O'Donnell</li>
<li>That Powers was the man</li>
<li>And soon on board of the</li>
<li>Blamel Roseway</li>
<li>Face to face it stands</li>
<li>And the stranger he was drinking</li>
<li>His manners had seemed keen</li>
<li>It seemed as though he got a blow</li>
<li>That sought his mind to rain</li>
<li>He rushed up on O'Donnell</li>
<li>And he swore he'd have his life</li>
<li>When they but pierced his treacherous heart</li>
<li>In the presence of his wife</li>
<li>And O'Donnell was found</li>
<li>Guilty in the very first degree</li>
<li>Although he stood in self-defense</li>
<li>Before a brute at sea</li>
<li>Who brought his wretched family</li>
<li>To sorrow, grief, and shame</li>
<li>They were shaken with fear</li>
<li>And scorned to hear</li>
<li>Their cowardly father's name</li>
<li>Was O'Donnell a member of some kind of society?</li>
<li>Have you been sent out to find O'Donnell?</li>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>Well, among that clan of gales,</li>
<li>they wanted to get rid of this Carrie, see,</li>
<li>as he had informed on the fellows</li>
<li>that shot Cavendish and Burke</li>
<li>in Phoenix Park and Dublin.</li>
<li>When was that?</li>
<li>Oh, I think it was in the early '80s.</li>
<li>It'll tell from that book there.</li>
<li>And the?</li>
<li>Carrie Turnshake's evidence,</li>
<li>or Queen's evidence, they call it there.</li>
<li>And O'Donnell was the man</li>
<li>who the lot fell to, the Carrie?</li>
<li>The lot fell on him.</li>
<li>See, he came from Washington,</li>
<li>went back to Ireland.</li>
<li>There was a lot fell on him,</li>
<li>and he went on the Cannes Gough Castle.</li>
<li>They knew that Carrie was leaving Ireland,</li>
<li>going on the Cannes Gough Castle</li>
<li>to Cape Town.</li>
<li>That's in South Africa, you know.</li>
<li>Oh, Christ, a martyr would do well</li>
<li>in Ireland besides an informer.</li>
<li>Even here on this island.</li>
<li>Of course, that was handed down.</li>
<li>By God, you know I hate an informer.</li>
<li>And there are plenty of them.</li>
<li>There's tons of bootleggers and so on</li>
<li>over the place here on this.</li>
<li>What happens to an informer here on this island?</li>
<li>Oh, he don't, they just pass him up.</li>
<li>Life ain't worth living for him around here.</li>
