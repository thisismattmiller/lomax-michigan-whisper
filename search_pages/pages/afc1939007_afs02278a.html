<li>2278B.</li>
<li>The Sixth of May</li>
<li>It was on the sixth of May my visas, as you may understand.</li>
<li>Sherman ordered out his men all for to break exam.</li>
<li>The logs were piled mountains high, and the water it was red full strong.</li>
<li>And it carried away poor Tebow and the logs that he was on.</li>
<li>Tebow wasn't a good man, he drove beneath a different stream.</li>
<li>It seemed that very morning that his last hour had come.</li>
<li>And that he had served his time on earth, that he was left to stay.</li>
<li>And he bid good-bye to all his friends up on the sixth of May.</li>
<li>He bravely faced the water and he boldly swam away.</li>
<li>He tried his best to save themself in every shape and way.</li>
<li>But the logs soon overtook him to our sad grief and woe.</li>
<li>And we found his grounded body in the Iraqi river O.</li>
<li>Out at Hick he came from Sarnac, the truth I will explain.</li>
<li>He tried his best to save him, but it was all in vain.</li>
<li>For the water did wash over him, he had to let him go.</li>
<li>And away went poor Tebow till he met his God we know.</li>
<li>And Tebow leaves a widow and five young children small.</li>
<li>Unto the mercy of their friend who drives the rackets bound.</li>
<li>A subscription was made up for them and each man he shared his pay.</li>
<li>To feed and to clothe those orphans, he left behind that day.</li>
<li>Now I bid you all good-bye-bye as our time has come to go.</li>
<li>To answer at the judgment's bar for those sins on earth below.</li>
<li>And known but the Creator, no mark or tongue can tell.</li>
<li>The agony of this poor man went unto the waterspout.</li>
<li>- Where did you run the phone?</li>
<li>- Up on the Dredgen River.</li>
<li>The name of the fellow, Jack Sparrow.</li>
<li>It told Tebow.</li>
<li>- He said he came with a knife and you slung it off his hand one time.</li>
<li>- He said his brothers slept on the same bunk with Tebow.</li>
<li>Before they slept together in the same bunk as they can.</li>
<li>- This was an actual incident then?</li>
<li>- This was an actual incident.</li>
<li>- Oh yeah, indeed.</li>
<li>- Tell them separate.</li>
<li>- And where, where did that happen?</li>
<li>- In New York. The Drack of River in New York.</li>
<li>- Where were you from?</li>
<li>- I'm from Diving Rock.</li>
<li>- How long did it take you to run?</li>
<li>- How long?</li>
<li>- One time.</li>
<li>[The End]</li>
<li>[Silence]</li>
