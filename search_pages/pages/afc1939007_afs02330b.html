<li>AFS recording number 2330, side B.</li>
<li>2 months old.</li>
<li>You want the whole thing?</li>
<li>Well, when you want the whole thing.</li>
<li>Oh, my father went to the war when I was 2 months old.</li>
<li>And he told my mother to sell out her all his fishing rigs and go to South Bend, Indiana.</li>
<li>Where my grandfather lived on my father's side, see?</li>
<li>And stay there as he come back.</li>
<li>Why, then they'd moved back to their old fishing ground again.</li>
<li>But he was killed in '64 in the Siege of Atlantis.</li>
<li>He never come back.</li>
<li>And my mother left South Bend when I was 8 years old.</li>
<li>And we come back to our old place where my father left, see, where we left.</li>
<li>In Sag Bay, Michigan.</li>
<li>My mother got married then, you see, after she came back, a year or two after that.</li>
<li>Oh, I'll say around a year and a half or something like that.</li>
<li>She got married to another fisherman.</li>
<li>And I was 8 years old the time she got married.</li>
<li>Well, I was past 8 years old.</li>
<li>But anyway, we moved then to St. Martin's Island on Green Bay.</li>
<li>And we fished there a few years, you know, 3 or 4 years on that island.</li>
<li>And then we moved over to the main shores.</li>
<li>And then from that, we fished with him.</li>
<li>I went in with him in the sailboat when I was 10 years old.</li>
<li>To steer the boat while him and his hired man would do the work in the boat, you see.</li>
<li>And he taught me how to steer the boat.</li>
<li>Well, then I stayed with him until I was 15 years old.</li>
<li>I thought now, if I've got to serve my life around this shore here with these little sailboats,</li>
<li>I'm going to ship onto some bigger vessel where I'll learn something.</li>
<li>So I left him and I went onto the bigger vessel.</li>
<li>And from that time until I was 33 years old, I followed the lake.</li>
<li>Got me?</li>
<li>Do you remember the names of the boats you sailed on?</li>
<li>Yes, sir. His name was Bob Graham.</li>
<li>And I sailed on to Lucy Graham.</li>
<li>She was named after his daughter.</li>
<li>Do you remember the names of the other boats you sailed on?</li>
<li>After that, yes.</li>
<li>After I left him, I went sailing on another fish trader.</li>
<li>You know, these boats were fish traders.</li>
<li>These vessels.</li>
<li>His name was Sanders, Nate Sanders.</li>
<li>And the name of the boat was a Mary Gregory.</li>
<li>The name of the schooner was a Mary Gregory.</li>
<li>What were the names of some other boats that you sailed on?</li>
<li>After that?</li>
<li>Uh-huh.</li>
<li>Well, then I went into the schooner merchant with Billy Umpston.</li>
<li>Captain Billy Umpston. He was another fish.</li>
<li>He was another. He sailed these fish traders, you know.</li>
<li>Buying fish along the north shore and all around the island.</li>
<li>Green Bay Island, Green Bay shores, you know.</li>
<li>And then after I left him, I went into bigger vessels.</li>
<li>And they were grainers.</li>
<li>And they were iron ore vessels, grainers.</li>
<li>I sailed in a grainer from Chicago to Buffalo.</li>
<li>Three straight seasons in one vessel.</li>
<li>Her name was Guido Fister.</li>
<li>Was she a good boat? A big, free-mass schooner.</li>
<li>She carried 67,000 bushels of corn.</li>
<li>A grain.</li>
<li>What was the best boat you ever sailed on?</li>
<li>The fastest boat. Oh, the fastest boat.</li>
<li>I guess it was my own.</li>
<li>I left Chicago.</li>
<li>I bought that boat in Chicago in 1890.</li>
<li>1890.</li>
<li>I left there at four o'clock in the afternoon.</li>
<li>I hired a man there after I bought this boat, you know.</li>
<li>I hired a man to help me put her out.</li>
<li>And I was going to Charlevoix, Michigan.</li>
<li>I said, There's a resort country.</li>
<li>I'm going up there, and I'll make some money.</li>
<li>So we went up there, and I left Chicago.</li>
<li>At four o'clock in the afternoon, Doug told me I was in Chicago.</li>
<li>Quick.</li>
<li>And 41 hours, the time I left there, I was in Charlevoix.</li>
<li>380 miles.</li>
<li>How was it going? Well, I'll just say.</li>
<li>The southeast gala winds, that was the name.</li>
<li>That little boat, 43 foot boat.</li>
<li>And what was that trip that you made down from,</li>
<li>that flash trip that you made down to Charlevoix?</li>
<li>Here? Yeah.</li>
<li>Thirty-six hours. From where?</li>
<li>From St. Martin's Bay, right down here, is what we call Sheldon's Cut.</li>
<li>We rode it to Cedar Coast and Telegraph Coast.</li>
<li>We left there with a northeast wind, right wind,</li>
<li>and we got outside of St. Helene Island.</li>
<li>We got its pressure and kept getting its pressure right along.</li>
<li>And we got one that passed us south, manned through the island.</li>
<li>We took in our chopters, and we punched it right through to Chicago</li>
<li>with all of our lower cams except the flying jib.</li>
<li>I mean, our jig chopters.</li>
<li>We took in our jib chopters, and that's all we took in.</li>
<li>That's how bad that was actually.</li>
<li>Thirty-six hours.</li>
<li>(applause)</li>
